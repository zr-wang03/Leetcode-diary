# 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node

* Medium
*   You are given a **perfect binary tree** where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree has the following definition:

    ```
    struct Node {
      int val;
      Node *left;
      Node *right;
      Node *next;
    }
    ```

    Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

    Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

### Analysis&#x20;

Like what we have done before in tree traversals,we can create an array of each of the levels of the nodes. Then we just have to make them link with each other, this can be easily done by doing that backwards.&#x20;

```
class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: 'Optional[Node]') -> 'Optional[Node]':
        if not root:
            return root
        stack=[root]
        while stack:


            level=[]
            for node in stack:
                if node.left:
                    level.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    level.append(node.right)
            
            stack=level

            prev=None
            for node in reversed(level): 
                node.next=prev
                prev=node

            
        return root
```
