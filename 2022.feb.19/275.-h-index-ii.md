# 275. H-Index II

* Medium
*   Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper and `citations` is sorted in an **ascending order**, return compute the researcher's `h`**-index**.

    According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): A scientist has an index `h` if `h` of their `n` papers have at least `h` citations each, and the other `n âˆ’ h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.

    If there are several possible values for `h`, the maximum one is taken as the `h`**-index**.

    You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.
*   Note:&#x20;

    * `citations` is sorted in **ascending order**.



### Analysis&#x20;

When asked to make an algorithm that runs in log time, the first thing that comes to mind is binary search. Here the only difference is that what we need is equal to the index value+the value at that index.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations):
        if not citations: return 0
        n = len(citations)
        beg, end = 0, n - 1
        while beg <= end:
            mid = (beg + end)//2
            if mid + citations[mid] >= n:
                end = mid - 1
            else:
                beg = mid + 1                
        return n - beg
```
