# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

* Easy
* Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.
* According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest\_common\_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**).”

### Solution 1

```
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        while (root.val-p.val)*(root.val-q.val)>0:
            if p.val<root.val:
                root=root.left
            else:
                root=root.right
        return root
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This solution takes advantage of the properties of a BST. If the current value is between the two values we are looking for, that means we have found the common ancestor.
