# 328. Odd Even Linked List

* Medium
*   Given the `head` of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return _the reordered list_.

    The **first** node is considered **odd**, and the **second** node is **even**, and so on.

    Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

    You must solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` time complexity.

        ehead=even
        while even and even.next:
            odd.next=odd.next.next
            even.next=even.next.next
            odd=odd.next
