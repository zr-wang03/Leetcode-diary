# 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV

* Hard
*   You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `k`.

    Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k` transactions.

    **Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

### Analysis

This problem is the same as [123.-best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii.md](123.-best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii.md "mention") but changing the number of transactions from 2 to k. Therefore we need to generalize the idea.&#x20;

In the previous problem, we used buy1,buy2,profit1,profit2. That is easy to be expressed using an array. &#x20;

There is only one small add-on, we need to judge if k==0 at the first, if we are not allowed to make any transaction, then we can return 0 immediately.&#x20;

### Solution (Python)

```
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, k: int, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if k==0:
            return 0
        buy=[float('inf')]*k
        profit=[0]*k
        for i in prices:
            
            buy[0]=min(i,buy[0])
            profit[0]=max(profit[0],i-buy[0])
            
            for j in range(1,k):
                buy[j]=min(i-profit[j-1],buy[j])
                profit[j]=max(profit[j],i-buy[j])
        return profit[k-1]
```
