# 29. Divide Two Integers

* Medium
*   Given two integers `dividend` and `divisor`, divide two integers **without** using multiplication, division, and mod operator.

    The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, `8.345` would be truncated to `8`, and `-2.7335` would be truncated to `-2`.

    Return _the **quotient** after dividing_ `dividend` _by_ `divisor`.
* **Note:** Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the **32-bit** signed integer range: `[−231, 231 − 1]`. For this problem, if the quotient is **strictly greater than** `231 - 1`, then return `231 - 1`, and if the quotient is **strictly less than** `-231`, then return `-231`.

### Solution Python&#x20;

Note:  << means move one bit to he left, it works the same as multiply by 2.&#x20;

                res += i
                i <<= 1
                temp <<= 1
