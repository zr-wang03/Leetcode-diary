# 455. Assign Cookies

* Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie.
* Each child `i` has a greed factor `g[i]`, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie `j` has a size `s[j]`. If `s[j] >= g[i]`, we can assign the cookie `j` to the child `i`, and the child `i` will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

class Solution:
    def findContentChildren(self, g: List[int], s: List[int]) -> int:
        child=len(g)
        cookie=len(s)
        
        #sort greed factor and cookie size in descending order
        g=sorted(g,reverse=True)
        s=sorted(s,reverse=True)
        
        
        
        #basic idea: for each cookie, go through all the children left(in descending order). When meets the first satified ("contented") child, assign the biscuit to him/her. If there is no match, then the rest of the cookies would not be able to be assigned to anyone, and it is safe that we return
        
        
        count=0
        satisfied=-1 #this '-1' is just for setting the pointer 0 during the first round 
        
        
        for i in s:
            flag=0
            pointer=satisfied+1
            #'satisfied' records the last child who was given a cookie, since we can only give one child one cookie, it is reasonable that we skip that kid
            while pointer<child and flag==0:
                if i>=g[pointer]:
                    count+=1
                    satisfied=pointer
                    flag=1
                pointer+=1
            if flag==0: #if the current cannot content any of the child, then the rest will not either
                return count
            
        return count #this is the case when all the cookies have been assigned
```

        #The solution above uses two loops, so why don't we solve it using just one loop? If we look at the children instead of looking at the biscuits, we can do this
        
        g.sort()
        s.sort()
        children=len(g)

                #if statment evaluates the statement from left to right, it only evaluates the second part is the first part is True. 
                
                #Therefore since there is a chance pointer will be larger than children, we will have to check it first, otherwise the index will be larger than the list
