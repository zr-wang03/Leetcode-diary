# 617. Merge Two Binary Trees

* Easy
* You are given two binary trees `root1` and `root2`.
*   Imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other, some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not. You need to merge the two trees into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap, then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node. Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of the new tree.

    Return _the merged tree_.
* **Note:** The merging process must start from the root nodes of both trees.

Runtime: **155 ms**Memory Usage: **15.5 MB**

```
class Solution:
    def mergeTrees(self, root1: Optional[TreeNode], root2: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:

        if root1 and root2:
            ans=TreeNode(root1.val+root2.val)
            ans.left=self.mergeTrees(root1.left,root2.left)
            ans.right=self.mergeTrees(root1.right,root2.right)
            return ans
        else:
            return root1 or root2
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Recursive method and created a new tree for answer. The answer is slower beacuse in each recursion it is creating a new 'TreeNode'**

### Solution 2

Runtime: **126 ms**Memory Usage: **15.4 MB**

```
class Solution:
    def mergeTrees(self, root1: Optional[TreeNode], root2: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not (root1 or root2):
            return None

        if not root1 and root2:
            return root2
        
        if root1 and not root2:
            return root1
        
        root1.val += root2.val
        
        root1.left = self.mergeTrees(root1.left, root2.left)
        root1.right = self.mergeTrees(root1.right, root2.right)
        
        return root1
        
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Instead of creating a new tree, this method works by operating on the existing tree.&#x20;

This should be faster but I don't understand why it is not.
