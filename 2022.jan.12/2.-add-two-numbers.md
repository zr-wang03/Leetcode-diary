# 2. Add Two Numbers

* Medium
*   You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

    You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Analysis

For each addition on each digit, there are three values to be added, l1.val, l2.val and also the leftover from the previous digit addition.&#x20;

We save time doing this addition by using l1 as the answer list instead of creating our own new list.&#x20;

        temp=(remainder+l1.val+l2.val)%10

        l1.val=temp

        while l1.next and l2.next:
            l1=l1.next
            l2=l2.next

            l1.val=temp  
        
        #if l2 is longer than l1, then we link the rest of l2 to l1 
        if l2.next:
            l1.next=l2.next

        #if there are still leftovers we continue adding them

        #if we have things like 9+1=10 that needs an extra digit, we give it an extra digit
