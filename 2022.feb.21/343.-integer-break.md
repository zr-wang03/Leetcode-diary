# 343. Integer Break

* Medium
*   Given an integer `n`, break it into the sum of `k` **positive integers**, where `k >= 2`, and maximize the product of those integers.

    Return _the maximum product you can get_.

### Analysis&#x20;

We already know it is better if we can separate the integer into smaller values because that would give an exponential increase speed. The problem is therefore whether we want to separate it to 2,3,4,5 or so. Here we can see that 4=2\*2=2+2, so separating it 2 would be better than 4. 5=2+3<2\*3. Now the problem is, 2 or 3? Let's check 6, 6=2+2+2=3+3, 2\*2\*2<3\*3. Therefore we want to separate it into as much 3s as possible. But there is one corner to notice, when we come to the end of the separation, if we have 4, we don't want it to become 1+3 since 1\*3=3<4.&#x20;

Therefore after the separation, we want to see if the remainder is 1. If so, then we might as well add it back.&#x20;

        return (3**a)*b
