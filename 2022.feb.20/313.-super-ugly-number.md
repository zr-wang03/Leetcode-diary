# 313. Super Ugly Number

* Medium
*   A **super ugly number** is a positive integer whose prime factors are in the array `primes`.

    Given an integer `n` and an array of integers `primes`, return _the_ `nth` _**super ugly number**_.

    The `nth` **super ugly number** is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** signed integer.


*   &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: n = 12, primes = [2,7,13,19]
    Output: 32
    Explanation: [1,2,4,7,8,13,14,16,19,26,28,32] is the sequence of the first 12 super ugly numbers given primes = [2,7,13,19].
    ```

### Analysis

Let's loo at the example. The ugly numbers are created using the numbers from the primes, but in another way that can help to solve the problem, they are created by multiplying with the previously created ugly numbers. Therefore it makes sense for us to try a DP solution to this question.&#x20;

No matter what the primes are, the first ugly number is always 1. Then we can choose the second one from \[1\*2,1\*7,1\*13,1\*19]. Here 1\*2=2 is the smallest of the later ones, therefore we choose it to be the second ugly number. Now the list for ugly number becomes \[ 1 , 2 ]. Now since 1\*13 and 1\*19 have not be picked, we don't have to take 2\*13 and 2\*19 into consideration, therefore what we want to check is \[2\*2, 1\*7, 1\*13, 1\*19].&#x20;

Then we check \[4\*2, 1\*7, 1\*13, 1\*19]. Here 1\*7 is the one we want, so the next list we build is \[4\*2 , 2\*7 , 1\*13 , 1\*19].&#x20;

Now the process is mostly explained, just one thing to cover, if we have 2\*7 and 7\*2 resulting in the same value, we only take one of them, but we need to update both.&#x20;

        for i in range(1, n):
            # compute possibly ugly numbers and update index
            for j in range(0, size):
                if ugly_nums[j] == ugly:
                    ugly_nums[j] = dp[index[j]] * primes[j]
                    index[j] += 1
            # get the minimum
            ugly = min(ugly_nums)
            dp.append(ugly)
        return dp[-1]
