# 331. Verify Preorder Serialization of a Binary Tree

* Medium
*   One way to serialize a binary tree is to use **preorder traversal**. When we encounter a non-null node, we record the node's value. If it is a null node, we record using a sentinel value such as `'#'`.

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/12/pre-tree.jpg)

    For example, the above binary tree can be serialized to the string `"9,3,4,#,#,1,#,#,2,#,6,#,#"`, where `'#'` represents a null node.

    Given a string of comma-separated values `preorder`, return `true` if it is a correct preorder traversal serialization of a binary tree.

    It is **guaranteed** that each comma-separated value in the string must be either an integer or a character `'#'` representing null pointer.

    You may assume that the input format is always valid.

    * For example, it could never contain two consecutive commas, such as `"1,,3"`.

    **Note:** You are not allowed to reconstruct the tree.

### Analysis&#x20;

In preorder traversal, we take the root first, then the left, then the right.&#x20;

Now since we are not required to find out where each node went, we can look at the more general hints that can help us solve this problem. Say we have a root that is not null, then we can add two more leaves to it, this means that while it takes up one space, it adds two spaces, therefore a non-null leave adds 1 available spaces. But in the case of a null node, it takes up one space and that is it. So when we encounter a null leaf, it reduces one space.&#x20;

Now we can go through the array and see if there is enough space for each of our leaves.&#x20;

    def isValidSerialization(self, preorder: str) -> bool:
        p=preorder.split(",")
        slot=1
        for i in p:
            if slot==0:
                return False
            
            if i=="#":
                slot-=1
            else:
                slot+=1
        return slot==0
```
