# 13. Roman to Integer

* Easy
*   Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: `I`, `V`, `X`, `L`, `C`, `D` and `M`.

    ```
    Symbol       Value
    I             1
    V             5
    X             10
    L             50
    C             100
    D             500
    M             1000
    ```

    For example, `2` is written as `II` in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. `12` is written as `XII`, which is simply `X + II`. The number `27` is written as `XXVII`, which is `XX + V + II`.

    Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not `IIII`. Instead, the number four is written as `IV`. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as `IX`. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

    * `I` can be placed before `V` (5) and `X` (10) to make 4 and 9.&#x20;
    * `X` can be placed before `L` (50) and `C` (100) to make 40 and 90.&#x20;
    * `C` can be placed before `D` (500) and `M` (1000) to make 400 and 900.

    Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

### Analysis

This is exactly the same as the [previous question](12.-integer-to-roman.md) , all we need to do is go through the string. First we try cutting it by 2 digit, if that is in the dic then we add it to the dic. If it is not in the dic, then this digit is not formed by subtraction and we can take that as a single roman digit.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        dic={"M":1000,"CM":900,"D":500,"CD":400,"C":100,"XC":90,"L":50,"XL":40,"X":10,"IX":9,"V":5,"IV":4,"I":1}
        n=len(s)
        l=0
        ans=0
        while l<n:
            if l+1<n:
                #print(s[l:l+2])
                if s[l:l+2] in dic:
                    ans+=dic[s[l:l+2]]
                    l+=2
                else:
                    ans+=dic[s[l]]
                    l+=1
            else:
                ans+=dic[s[l]]
                l+=1
            #print(ans)
        return ans
```

Or we could have used a solution according to its definition. If a digit represents a value less than its following digit, then we subtract it. Therefore we can go through the string digit by digit. Keep in mind the corner case: the last digit.&#x20;

    def romanToInt(self, s):
        roman = {'M': 1000,'D': 500 ,'C': 100,'L': 50,'X': 10,'V': 5,'I': 1}
        z = 0
        for i in range(0, len(s) - 1):
            if roman[s[i]] < roman[s[i+1]]:
                z -= roman[s[i]]
            else:
                z += roman[s[i]]
        return z + roman[s[-1]]
```
