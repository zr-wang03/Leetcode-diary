# 993. Cousins in Binary Tree

* Easy
* Given the `root` of a binary tree with unique values and the values of two different nodes of the tree `x` and `y`, return `true` _if the nodes corresponding to the values_ `x` _and_ `y` _in the tree are **cousins**, or_ `false` _otherwise._
* Two nodes of a binary tree are **cousins** if they have the same depth with different parents.
* Note that in a binary tree, the root node is at the depth `0`, and children of each depth `k` node are at the depth `k + 1`.
