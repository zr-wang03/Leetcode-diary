# 322. Coin Change

* Medium
*   You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

    Return _the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount_. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

    You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

### Analysis&#x20;

It is clear that this can be solved using a bottom up DP.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        n = len(coins)
        coins.sort()
        dp = [math.inf] * (amount+1)
        dp[0] = 0
        
        for amnt in range(1, amount+1):
            for coin in coins:
                if amnt >= coin:
                    dp[amnt] = min(dp[amnt], dp[amnt-coin] + 1)
                    
        return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != math.inf else -1
