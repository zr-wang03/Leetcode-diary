# 473. Matchsticks to Square

* Medium
*   You are given an integer array `matchsticks` where `matchsticks[i]` is the length of the `ith` matchstick. You want to use **all the matchsticks** to make one square. You **should not break** any stick, but you can link them up, and each matchstick must be used **exactly one time**.

    Return `true` if you can make this square and `false` otherwise.



### Analysis&#x20;

The first ideas that come to mind is to check if the sum of the matchsticks is divisble by 4. If it is not, then there isn't going to be a chance that it is separatable at all. But what to do next?&#x20;

For each of the stick we are looking at, it can be going into one of the four edges. So the brute force solution would be to check if the four situations fits. It is of O(4^N), but still it is acceptable in this case.&#x20;

```
class Solution:
    def makesquare(self, matchsticks: List[int]) -> bool:
        perimeter = sum(matchsticks)
        if perimeter % 4 != 0:
            return False
        possible_side = perimeter / 4
        
        matchsticks.sort(reverse=True)
        sums = [0, 0, 0, 0]
        
        def dfs(cur):
            if cur == len(matchsticks):
                return sums[0] == sums[1] == sums[2] == possible_side
            
            for i in range(4):
                if sums[i] + matchsticks[cur] <= possible_side:
                    sums[i] += matchsticks[cur]
                    if dfs(cur + 1):
                        return True
                    sums[i] -= matchsticks[cur]
                
            return False

        return dfs(0)
```

What we might do to make this even faster is to cache the cases. Even though there are only 4 edges, there are still cases when the configuration is the same as one we have seen before, if that is the case, we can save a lot of branches in the search.&#x20;
