# 310. Minimum Height Trees

* Medium
*   A tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are connected by _exactly_ one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.

    Given a tree of `n` nodes labelled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array of `n - 1` `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the two nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree, you can choose any node of the tree as the root. When you select a node `x` as the root, the result tree has height `h`. Among all possible rooted trees, those with minimum height (i.e. `min(h)`)  are called **minimum height trees** (MHTs).

    Return _a list of all **MHTs'** root labels_. You can return the answer in **any order**.

    The **height** of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward path between the root and a leaf.

*   **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,0],[1,2],[1,3]]
    Output: [1]
    Explanation: As shown, the height of the tree is 1 when the root is the node with label 1 which is the only MHT.

                    edges.remove(j)
                    print(i,j)
                    rest=j.copy()

This is a small part to modify the list and search for the parts of the list with the number we are looking for.&#x20;

The use of 'copy' here is to generate a new list. With that we can modify the new list without changing the old one. If we use "=" then it will change the old one as well.&#x20;

First try. Exceedes time limit.&#x20;

The first idea is to first make sure the function is correctly excuted. This program can deal with the problem, but when it comes to a large value of N, it needs optimization.&#x20;

```
class Solution:
    def findMinHeightTrees(self, n, E):
        G, seen = defaultdict(set), [False]*n
        for u,v in E:
            G[u].add(v)
            G[v].add(u)
            
        def dfs(i):
            if seen[i]: return 0
            seen[i] = True
            H = 1 + max((dfs(adj) for adj in G[i]), default=0)
            seen[i] = False
            return H
        
        min_H=inf
        ans=[]

            H = dfs(i)

                min_H = H

This is similar method but uses recursion. This is a little optimized but still fails the time limit.&#x20;

### Solution

Think about it this way. Given a rope with many knots, what we are looking for is a knot where we can pick it up so that the rope is 'balanced' on both sides. Or we can say that the two sides of the rope hanging around at the minimum height. &#x20;

![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1).png>)

To do this, we can start by elimating all of the leaves from the orginal 'tree'. Because we know if we lift a 'tree' or a 'rope' on the end points, we will definitly get the longest result.&#x20;

We can then continue to do this in a similar fashion. When we end with one or two points left(the rope might not be toally balanced so the best solution is not on the knots), we know we have the point we are looking for.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def findMinHeightTrees(self, n, E):
        if not E: return [0]
        G, seen = defaultdict(set), [False]*n
        for u,v in E:
            G[u].add(v)
            G[v].add(u)
        leaves, new_leaves, in_degree = [], [], []
        for i in range(n):
            if len(G[i]) == 1:
                leaves.append(i)
            in_degree.append(len(G[i]))
        while n > 2:
            for leaf in leaves:
                for adj in G[leaf]:
                    in_degree[adj] -= 1
                    if in_degree[adj] == 1:
                        new_leaves.append(adj)
            n -= len(leaves)
            leaves = new_leaves[:]
            new_leaves.clear()
        return leaves
