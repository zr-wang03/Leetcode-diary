# 227. Basic Calculator II

* Medium
*   Given a string `s` which represents an expression, _evaluate this expression and return its value_.&#x20;

    The integer division should truncate toward zero.

    You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in the range of `[-231, 231 - 1]`.

    **Note:** You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

### Analysis&#x20;

We are applying stack in this solution. When we meet a digit, we add it to the current digit as string. For example, if we have "3" and then "4" we add it like 3\*10+4=34.&#x20;

If we meet any thing that is not a digit or a space, then we meet one of "+-\*/". However we are not going to deal with the one we meet now, but the sign we meet the last time. Therefore we use a variable prev\_s_ign to record that. We assume the first prev\_sign is "+" because that wouldn't affect the result of the calculation and it would help us go throught the process._&#x20;

    def calculate(self, s):
        if not s:
            return "0"
        stack, num, prev_sign = [], 0, "+"
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i].isdigit():
                num = num*10+int(s[i])
            if (not s[i].isdigit() and not s[i].isspace()) or i == len(s)-1:
                if prev_sign == "-":
                    stack.append(-num)
                elif prev_sign == "+":
                    stack.append(num)
                elif prev_sign == "*":
                    stack.append(stack.pop()*num)
                else:
                    tmp = stack.pop()
                    if tmp//num < 0 and tmp%num != 0:
                        stack.append(tmp//num+1)
                    else:
                        stack.append(tmp//num)
                prev_sign = s[i]
                num = 0
        return sum(stack)
