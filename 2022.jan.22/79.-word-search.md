# 79. Word Search

* Medium
*   Given an `m x n` grid of characters `board` and a string `word`, return `true` _if_ `word` _exists in the grid_.

    The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once.

### Analysis&#x20;

The solution here uses DFS(Deep first search). It is similar to backtrcking but is used to solve a graph problem（and also about relationships）. For each node in the graph, we randomly choose a node that is connected to it. If the node we chose has been visited (use a list or dic to record that fact), then we back track. Eventually when our code will go through all the connected nodes and eventually back track to the starting point.&#x20;
