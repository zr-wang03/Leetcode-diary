# 2134. Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together II

* Medium
*   A **swap** is defined as taking two **distinct** positions in an array and swapping the values in them.

    A **circular** array is defined as an array where we consider the **first** element and the **last** element to be **adjacent**.

    Given a **binary** **circular** array `nums`, return _the minimum number of swaps required to group all_ `1`_'s present in the array together at **any location**_.

### Analysis&#x20;

First thing to remeber, whenever we meet some question that asks for a circular array, we can try append the array to it self. ( n.extend(n) )

Now this is an easy sliding window problem with fixed window width. First we calculate the width of the window, then we looking for windows of that size with the most 1s in it. Then the result we are looking for is the total number of 1s minus the maximum value of 1s currently in any window of the fixed size.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def minSwaps(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ones=0
        for i in nums:
            ones+=i
        nums.extend(nums)
        sumi=0
        for j in range(ones):
            sumi+=nums[j]
        maxi=sumi
        for j in range(ones,len(nums)-1):
            sumi=sumi+nums[j]-nums[j-ones]
            maxi=max(maxi,sumi)
        return ones-maxi
