# 274. H-Index

* Medium
*   Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper, return compute the researcher's `h`**-index**.

    According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): A scientist has an index `h` if `h` of their `n` papers have at least `h` citations each, and the other `n âˆ’ h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.

    If there are several possible values for `h`, the maximum one is taken as the `h`**-index**.

### Analysis&#x20;

A easy solution would be using sorting. After sorting, we can find the value of h according to the definition by going in the array one by one.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:
        citations.sort()
        count=0
        length=len(citations)
        for i in range(length):
            if citations[i]>=length-i:
                return length-i
        return 0
```
