# 319. Bulb Switcher

* Medium
*   There are `n` bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs, then you turn off every second bulb.

    On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the `ith` round, you toggle every `i` bulb. For the `nth` round, you only toggle the last bulb.

    Return _the number of bulbs that are on after `n` rounds_.

### Analysis&#x20;

This is a pure math problem. The answer is equal to the amount of perfect quare numbers less than the total number bulb, which can be written as floor(sqrt(n)).&#x20;
