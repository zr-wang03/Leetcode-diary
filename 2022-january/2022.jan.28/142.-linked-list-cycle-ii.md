# 142. Linked List Cycle II

* Medium
*   Given the `head` of a linked list, return _the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return_ `null`.

    There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the `next` pointer. Internally, `pos` is used to denote the index of the node that tail's `next` pointer is connected to (**0-indexed**). It is `-1` if there is no cycle. **Note that** `pos` **is not passed as a parameter**.

    **Do not modify** the linked list.

### Analysis&#x20;

We take one node called fast and one called slow. The fast node goes at 2 nodes per step and the slow goes at 1 nodes per step. if fast and slow meet, then it must be in the cycle. If not, we can return Null indicating there is not a cycle in the linked list.&#x20;

Now if the two pointers do meet. We set the length of the cycle to be N and the length from the start of the linked list to the head of the cycle to be X and the position where slow and fast meet is Y from the start of the cycle. We would have that :

slow has stepped (X+Y)   and fast stepped 2(X+Y).&#x20;

Therefore fast-slow=X+Y is some mutliple of N.&#x20;

Now if we let head and slow to step at the same speed and step X steps. Then the place where slow is at is X+X+Y, we also have that X+Y is some mutliple of N, therefore slow would be now at the place X, which is the start of the cycle. Now we also know that head had stepped X steps so it would meet slow at this time.&#x20;

Since the value X is what we are looking for, we can do the previous steps and let head and slow step forward together until they meet. And the point they meet would be X, the point where the cycle starts and the point we are looking for.&#x20;

            if fast==slow:
                flag=1
                break
        if flag==0:
            return None
        while slow!=head:
            head=head.next 
            slow=slow.next
