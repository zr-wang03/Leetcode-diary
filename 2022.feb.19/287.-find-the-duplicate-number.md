# 287. Find the Duplicate Number

* Medium
*   Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

    There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return _this repeated number_.

    You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums` and uses only constant extra space.

### Analysis&#x20;

I have to admit that I have no idea why people can come up with the idea similar to the one in [142.-linked-list-cycle-ii.md](../2022.jan.28/142.-linked-list-cycle-ii.md "mention"). But now since I know the solution, the problem here is how to explain it works.&#x20;

Since we have \[1,n] different values and 1 duplicate, and we also have an array numbered from 0 to n, we can consider them to be pointing to the point as shown in their value.&#x20;

For example, in the array \[1 3 4 2 2], the "1" is pointing to the place with index 1, which is "3", then it points to index "3" which is 4.&#x20;

Now since we don't have a value 0, there is no way we can go back to index 0. Then there would always be a cycle that appears in the path since there is a dupicate and it would not exceed the size of the array.&#x20;

Therefore we can apply the same method in question 142 and find the cycle. And if you think about it, the entry to the cycle is always the duplicate we are looking for.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        slow=nums[0]
        fast=nums[nums[0]]
        while (slow!=fast):
            slow=nums[slow]
            fast=nums[nums[fast]]
        
        fast=0
        while (fast!=slow):
            fast=nums[fast]
            slow=nums[slow]
        return slow

```
