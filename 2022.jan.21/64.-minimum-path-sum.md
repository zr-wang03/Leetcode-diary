# 64. Minimum Path Sum

* Medium
*   Given a `m x n` `grid` filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

    **Note:** You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

### Analysis&#x20;

This question is based on the same thing as question [63.-unique-paths-ii.md](../2022.jan.20/63.-unique-paths-ii.md "mention"). Therefore we just need to think of new ideas to deal with the corners and sides. For those grids on the right side of the picture, we need to make sure that it can only come from the grid below it, so we can set the value of the grid to the right of it to be infinty to make sure the path will not come from that direction. (There is not such a grid but we can do that using a variable. ) Then the same thing applies for those on the lowest row.&#x20;

The problem left is the right-down corner, the end. We have to set its value to be exactly its own sum or according to the previous procedure it would be set to be infinity.&#x20;
