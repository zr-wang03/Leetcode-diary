# 207. Course Schedule

* Medium
*   There are a total of `numCourses` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1`. You are given an array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you **must** take course `bi` first if you want to take course `ai`.

    * For example, the pair `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take course `0` you have to first take course `1`.

    Return `true` if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Analysis&#x20;

The core of this problem is to find cycles in the graph. To do this, we create a list called state to record the state of each node during our search. We also create an adjacency graph to help us go through the nodes.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def buildAdjacencyList(self, n, edgesList):
        adjList = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        # c2 (course 2) is a prerequisite of c1 (course 1)
        # i.e c2c1 is a directed edge in the graph
        for c1, c2 in edgesList:
            adjList[c2].append(c1)
        return adjList
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        adjList=self.buildAdjacencyList(numCourses, prerequisites)
        state=[0]*numCourses
        
        #state=0 is the default 
        #state=1 means we have visited this node and all its adjacencies
        #state=-1 means the node is currently being investigated, if we run into a -1 node then it means we have find a cycle
        def hascycle(v):
            if state[v]==1:
                return False
            if state[v]==-1:
                return True
            
            state[v]=-1
            for i in adjList[v]:
                if hascycle(i):
                    return True
                
            state[v]=1
            
            return False 
        
        for v in range(numCourses):
            if hascycle(v):
                return False
        return True
