# 436. Find Right Interval

* Medium
*   You are given an array of `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` and each `starti` is **unique**.

    The **right interval** for an interval `i` is an interval `j` such that `startj >= endi` and `startj` is **minimized**.

    Return _an array of **right interval** indices for each interval `i`_. If no **right interval** exists for interval `i`, then put `-1` at index `i`.

### Analysis&#x20;

It seems helpful if we have a sorted list of "start"s and do binary search in that to find the interval that we want. However, we also need the initial position of the starts. So, we are creating a 2d array that records \[start, end, index].&#x20;

Notice: Here the "bisect" function runs binary search and returns the index i for us to insert x into the array. The index i returned satisfy the following: for all items less then i, they are less then x. For those that are bigger than i, they are equal to or bigger than x.&#x20;

        begs = [i for i,_,_ in ints]
        out = [-1]*len(begs)
        for i,j,k in ints:
            t = bisect.bisect_left(begs, j)
            if t < len(begs):
                out[k] = ints[t][2]
        
        return out
