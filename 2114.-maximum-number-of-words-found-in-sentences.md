# 2114. Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences

* Easy
* A **sentence** is a list of **words** that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.
* You are given an array of strings `sentences`, where each `sentences[i]` represents a single **sentence**.
* Return _the **maximum number of words** that appear in a single sentence_.

                    count+=1
            #the number of spaces will always be one less than the total number of words
            count+=1

    int max=0;
    for (int i=0;i<sentencesSize;i++)
    {
        int length=strlen(sentences[i]);
        char* sentence=sentences[i];
        int count=1;
        for (int j=0;j<length;j++)
        {
            if (sentence[j]==32)
            {
                count+=1;
