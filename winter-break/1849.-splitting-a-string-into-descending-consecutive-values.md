# 1849. Splitting a String Into Descending Consecutive Values

* Medium
*   You are given a string `s` that consists of only digits.

    Check if we can split `s` into **two or more non-empty substrings** such that the **numerical values** of the substrings are in **descending order** and the **difference** between numerical values of every two **adjacent** **substrings** is equal to `1`.

    * For example, the string `s = "0090089"` can be split into `["0090", "089"]` with numerical values `[90,89]`. The values are in descending order and adjacent values differ by `1`, so this way is valid.
    * Another example, the string `s = "001"` can be split into `["0", "01"]`, `["00", "1"]`, or `["0", "0", "1"]`. However all the ways are invalid because they have numerical values `[0,1]`, `[0,1]`, and `[0,0,1]` respectively, all of which are not in descending order.

    Return `true` _if it is possible to split_ `s`​​​​​​ _as described above, or_ `false` _otherwise._

    A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

### Analysis&#x20;

This problem would be a little easier to think from the back. A '0' in the start might not be useful because it is part of '01' or '023' etc. But a '0' in the back is not. So, we can start from the back and try to slice the array at different length.&#x20;

Things to notice:

1. The numbers may not be of same length: for example in the list '10009998': "100"+"0"+"99"+"98" is a acceptable way of splitting. But if we are restricting the slice into 2 figures because 98 is an 2 figure number, then we will not be able to get to '100'.&#x20;

&#x20; 2\.  We should check if the digits can be part of the number before checking if they are '0'. Suppose we want to find "50", if we did the above in a reversed sequence, then the program will see '0' and then '5', without the opportunity to see '50'.

&#x20; 3\. If there is only one number then it doesn't satifsy the requirement. For example, "0001", we cannot split it into itself. Therefore we should have a counter to count if we have more than one number being splitted. &#x20;
