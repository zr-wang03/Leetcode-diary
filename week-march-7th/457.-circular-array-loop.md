# 457. Circular Array Loop

* Medium
*   You are playing a game involving a **circular** array of non-zero integers `nums`. Each `nums[i]` denotes the number of indices forward/backward you must move if you are located at index `i`:

    * If `nums[i]` is positive, move `nums[i]` steps **forward**, and
    * If `nums[i]` is negative, move `nums[i]` steps **backward**.

    Since the array is **circular**, you may assume that moving forward from the last element puts you on the first element, and moving backwards from the first element puts you on the last element.

    A **cycle** in the array consists of a sequence of indices `seq` of length `k` where:

    * Following the movement rules above results in the repeating index sequence `seq[0] -> seq[1] -> ... -> seq[k - 1] -> seq[0] -> ...`
    * Every `nums[seq[j]]` is either **all positive** or **all negative**.
    * `k > 1`

    Return `true` _if there is a **cycle** in_ `nums`_, or_ `false` _otherwise_.

            while True:
                if (forward and nums[j] < 0) or (not forward and nums[j] > 0):
                    break
                nextj = (j + nums[j] + n) % n
                if nextj == j:
                    break
                j = nextj
                linkLength += 1
                if linkLength > n:
                    return True
        return False
