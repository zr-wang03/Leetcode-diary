# 143. Reorder List

* Medium
*   You are given the head of a singly linked-list. The list can be represented as:

    ```
    L0 → L1 → … → Ln - 1 → Ln
    ```

    _Reorder the list to be on the following form:_

    ```
    L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln - 1 → L2 → Ln - 2 → …
    ```

    You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

### Analysis&#x20;

The solution uses 3 steps to solve this problem. The first part is to separate the linked list into two parts at the middle point. Then we reversed the second part of the linked list, which is step two. The last step is to interleaving merging the two lists.&#x20;
