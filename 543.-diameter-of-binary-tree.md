# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

* Easy
* Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the length of the **diameter** of the tree_.
* The **diameter** of a binary tree is the **length** of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the `root`.
* The **length** of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        self.dia=0
        def dfs(node):
            if not node:

            left=dfs(node.left)
            right=dfs(node.right)
            curr=left+right
            if curr>self.dia:
                self.dia=curr
            return 1+max(left,right)

        dfs(root)
        return self.dia

**This is a recursive method. The diameter we are looking for comes from a node that is the root to both of theW**
