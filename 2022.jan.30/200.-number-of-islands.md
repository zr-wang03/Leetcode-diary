# 200. Number of Islands

* Medium
*   Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

    An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

### Analysis&#x20;

The idea is that whenever we find a new island, we go through all the grids around it and see if it belongs to the same island, if it does, we color it with something else.&#x20;

    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        ans=0
        if not grid:
            return 0
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j]=="1":
                    self.color(grid,i,j)
                    ans+=1
        return ans
    
    def color(self,grid,i,j):
        if i<0 or j <0 or i>=len(grid) or j>=len(grid[0]) or grid[i][j]!="1":
            return 
        grid[i][j]="2"
        self.color(grid,i-1,j)
        self.color(grid,i+1,j)
        self.color(grid,i,j-1)
        self.color(grid,i,j+1)
        return
