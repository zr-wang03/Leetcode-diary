# 451. Sort Characters By Frequency

* Medium
*   Given a string `s`, sort it in **decreasing order** based on the **frequency** of the characters. The **frequency** of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

    Return _the sorted string_. If there are multiple answers, return _any of them_.

### Analysis&#x20;

We will solve this by doint what the question tells us to do. First we record the frequency of the characters in a dictionary. Then we turn it into a list and sort it. Finally we build our  answer based on that list.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:
        def sort1(s):
            return s[1];
        
        
        dic=defaultdict(int)
        for char in s:
            dic[char]+=1
        occur=list(dic.items())
        occur.sort(key=sort1,reverse=True);
        
        ans=""
        for (i,j) in occur:
            ans+=i*j
            
        return ans
