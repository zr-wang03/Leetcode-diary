# 397. Integer Replacement

* Medium
*   Given a positive integer `n`, you can apply one of the following operations:

    1. If `n` is even, replace `n` with `n / 2`.
    2. If `n` is odd, replace `n` with either `n + 1` or `n - 1`.

    Return _the minimum number of operations needed for `n` to become `1`_.

### Analysis&#x20;

This can be solved using a greedy method. If the number is even, we have no choice but to divide it by two. If it is odd, then either n+1 or n-1 will be divisible by 4. We take that because that will help it to shrink faster. The only corner case is at 3 where we take 3-1=2 and 2/2=1.&#x20;

                moves += 1
                continue
            if n == 3:
                return moves + 2
            if (n + 1) % 4 == 0:      
                n = n + 1
            elif (n - 1) % 4 == 0:
                n = n - 1
            moves += 1
        return moves
