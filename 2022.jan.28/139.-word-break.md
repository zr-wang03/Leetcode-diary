# 139. Word Break

* Medium
*   Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, return `true` if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

    **Note** that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

### Analysis&#x20;

The following solution is a dynamic planning one. The basic idea is that for each site in the string, check if there is a word in the dictionary that fits till that digit. With that being said, we need that the segment of the string before that word also to be matched by some words.&#x20;

Therefore what we need is a if statment like this: word==s\[i-len(word)+1:i+1] and (i-len(word)==-1 or ans\[i-len(word)])

    def wordBreak(self, s: str, wordDict: List[str]) -> bool:
        ans=[False]*len(s)
        for i in range(len(s)):
            for word in wordDict:
                if word==s[i-len(word)+1:i+1] and (i-len(word)==-1 or ans[i-len(word)]):
                    ans[i]=True
        return ans[-1]
```
