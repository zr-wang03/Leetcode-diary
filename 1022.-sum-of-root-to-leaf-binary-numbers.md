# 1022. Sum of Root To Leaf Binary Numbers

* Easy
* You are given the `root` of a binary tree where each node has a value `0` or `1`.  Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.  For example, if the path is `0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1`, then this could represent `01101` in binary, which is `13`.
* For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf.
* Return _the sum of these numbers_. The answer is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bits** integer.

```
class Solution:
    def sumRootToLeaf(self, root: Optional[TreeNode],val=0) -> int:
        if not root: return 0
        val = val * 2 + root.val
        if root.left == root.right: return val
        return self.sumRootToLeaf(root.left, val) + self.sumRootToLeaf(root.right, val)
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This solution uses dfs to go through the trees and look for paths.&#x20;

The mechanism for adding is describe as:

for the left-most path: 1-0-0, it is like 1 x 2 x+0 x 2+0 = ((1 x 2^1+0) x 2^1+0) x 2^0 = 4+0\*1 = 4. which is each value is doubled when it is passed to child from parent node.
