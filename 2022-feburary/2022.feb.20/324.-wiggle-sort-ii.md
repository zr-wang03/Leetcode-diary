# 324. Wiggle Sort II

* Medium
*   Given an integer array `nums`, reorder it such that `nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3]...`.

    You may assume the input array always has a valid answer.

### Analysis&#x20;

The idea is simple, first we find the larger half and lower half, then we combine them together but in a one by one fashion. That would make sure the array we created would fit the requirement.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def wiggleSort(self, nums):
        nums.sort()
        half = len(nums[::2])
        nums[::2], nums[1::2] = nums[:half][::-1], nums[half:][::-1]
        
```
