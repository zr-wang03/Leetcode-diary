# 204. Count Primes

* Medium
* Given an integer `n`, return _the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than_ `n`.

### Analysis&#x20;

Probably not the best idea, but the first idea that comes to my mind is by going from the smallest to the biggest and erase all the multiples of prime numbers except themselves.&#x20;

The function isqrt is used to give the integer square root of something, meaning that it is rounded down to the nearest integer.&#x20;

    def countPrimes(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n<2:
            return 0
        primes=[1]*n
        primes[0],primes[1]=0,0
        d=isqrt(n)
        for i in range(2,d+1):
            if primes[i]==1:
                j=i*2
                while j<n:
                    primes[j]=0
                    j+=i
        #print(primes)
        return sum(primes)
