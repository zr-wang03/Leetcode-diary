# 316. Remove Duplicate Letters

* Medium
* Given a string `s`, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is **the smallest in lexicographical order** among all possible results.

### Analysis&#x20;

The harder point of this question is not about removing duplicates, rather it is about making sure it is in the smallest lexicographical order. Therfore when we go through the string, we take each letter and see if it fits in to the stack we are building, if the top of the stack is larger than this letter and it would appear again afterwards, we remove that top and add the current letter, else, we add the current letter.&#x20;

Therefore we just have to create a dictionary to record the place where each different letter's last occurence in this string, and if we are after that occurence, that letter would not appear again.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicateLetters(self, s):
        last_occ = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(s)}
        stack = ["!"]
        Visited = set()
        
        for i, symbol in enumerate(s):
            if symbol in Visited: continue
            
            while (symbol < stack[-1] and last_occ[stack[-1]] > i):
                Visited.remove(stack.pop())
           
            stack.append(symbol)
            Visited.add(symbol)        
        return "".join(stack)[1:]
```
