# 1910. Remove All Occurrences of a Substring

* Medium
*   Given two strings `s` and `part`, perform the following operation on `s` until **all** occurrences of the substring `part` are removed:

    * Find the **leftmost** occurrence of the substring `part` and **remove** it from `s`.

    Return `s` _after removing all occurrences of_ `part`.

    A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

### Solution&#x20;

First idea, to do what we are told to do. And actually the solution is not very bad.&#x20;

```
class Solution:
    def removeOccurrences(self, s: str, part: str) -> str:
        length=len(part)
        slen=len(s)
        count=1
        while count!=0:
            count=0
            i=0
            while i<=slen-length and count==0:
                if s[i:i+length]==part:
                    m=s[:i]+s[i+length:]
                    print(m)
                    count+=1
                i+=1
            if count!=0:
                s=m
        return s
```

Now if we think about it, by making an new string and adding the digits one at a time, we can solve this without going through the string over and over.&#x20;

Everytime we add a digit, we see if the resulting string has the 'part' in it, and that is only possible at the end of the string. If there is, we delete it.&#x20;

    def removeOccurrences(self, s: str, part: str) -> str:
        length=len(part)
        i=0
        ans=""
        while i<len(s):
            ans+=s[i]
            if len(ans)>=length and ans[-length:]==part:
                ans=ans[:-length]
            i+=1
        return ans 
```
