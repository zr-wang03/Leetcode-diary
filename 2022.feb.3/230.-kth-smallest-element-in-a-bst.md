# 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST

* Medium
* Given the `root` of a binary search tree, and an integer `k`, return _the_ `kth` _smallest value (**1-indexed**) of all the values of the nodes in the tree_.

### Analysis&#x20;

The idea is first go to the left most child, which is the smallest one according to the definition of a binary search tree. Then we traverse the tree and find the k th one.&#x20;

```
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        stack = []
        while root or stack:
            while root:
                stack.append(root)
                root = root.left
            root = stack.pop()
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                return root.val
            root = root.right
```
