# 162. Find Peak Element

* Medium
*   A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

    Given an integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

    You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž`.

    You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

### Analysis&#x20;

Good old O ( log n ). So this is going to be a binary search problem. Now we consider this situation, if a element is less than its right neighbour, what would happen? Clearly there would be a peak to the right of that element, being the neighbour or not doesn't matter but there would be, and thus we would have cut the problem into half the size.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        left=0
        right=len(nums)-1
        
        while left<right-1:
            mid = (left+right)//2
            if nums[mid] > nums[mid+1] and nums[mid] > nums[mid-1]:
                return mid

            if nums[mid] < nums[mid+1]:
                left = mid+1
            else:
                right = mid-1

        return left if nums[left] >= nums[right] else right   
```
