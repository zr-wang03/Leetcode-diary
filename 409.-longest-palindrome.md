# 409. Longest Palindrome

* Easy
*   Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return _the length of the **longest palindrome**_ that can be built with those letters.

    Letters are **case sensitive**, for example, `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.

### Solution 1 (C)

```
int longestPalindrome(char * s){
    int counttable[125]={0}; /*the ascii for 'z' is 122, 125 here is just to make sure it is bigger*/
    int length=strlen(s);
    int count=0;
    for (int i=0;i<length;i++)
    {
        counttable[s[i]]++;
        if (counttable[s[i]]%2==0) /*if there are two equal chars, then we can use both of them*/
        {
            count+=2;
        }
    }
    if (length==count) /* if we have used every single char in the string*/
    {
        return (count);
    }
    else    /* if there is chars left, we always can add one into the list*/
    {
        return (count+1);
    }
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
The initialization of counttable\[125]={0} is to set all the values in that array to be 0. This is extremely important becuase if we don't do that, the storage we are looking at will have garbage values before we start to use this program.&#x20;

### Solution (Python)

```
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> int:
        length=len(s)
        counttable=[0]*(123-65) #122 is ascii for 'z' and 65 is for 'A', the problem here is that there are other symbols represented between 'Z' and 'a'
        for i in s:
            index=ord(i)-ord("A")
            counttable[index]+=1
        count=0
        flag=0
        for j in counttable:
            if j%2==0:
                count+=j
            else:
                flag=1
                count+=(j-1)
        return (count+flag)
```
