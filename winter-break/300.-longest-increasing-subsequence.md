# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

* Medium
*   Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

    A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, `[3,6,2,7]` is a subsequence of the array `[0,3,1,6,2,2,7]`.

### Solution (Python)

#### Analysis    O(N^2)

Let's use the array \[0,3,1,6,2,2,7] as an example. If we want to find the longest subsequence starting with '3', the first thing we do is to find the numbers that come after it and is larger than it, which brings us '6' and '7'. Therefore, the number of longest subsequence starting with '3' is equal to max(1+number of longest subsequence starting with '6', 1+ number of longest subsequence starting with '7').&#x20;

So what about corner cases? When we are at the last number in the array, "7" in this case. The longest subsequence that starts with it is itself, so the value is equal to 1.&#x20;

Therefore there is a clear pattern for an recursive method, or we can build an array to do the same thing like the following solution.&#x20;

    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        length=len(nums)
        count=[None]*length
        count[length-1]=1
        for i in reversed(range(length-1)):
            maxi=1
            for j in range(i,length):
                if nums[j]>nums[i]:
                    maxi=max(maxi,count[j]+1)
            count[i]=maxi
        return max(count)      
```

#### Analysis 2     O(N log N)

(Also known as patience sorting)

Suppose we are playing the game [patience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patience\_sorting), for each new card we get, we try to place it according to the following two requirements:

1. We cannot add a larger number to any pile. Suppose the pile is already \[4,1] and now we have an 5, then it cannot be add into this pile.&#x20;
2. We can create new piles only when needed.&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3) (1) (1) (1).png>)

Now if we check this resulting distribution of cards, the number of piles equal to the largest possible number of LIS we are looking for.&#x20;

Proof: To choose an increasing sequence, at most one card can be used from each pile.&#x20;

Therefore we can solve this problem using an array representing the top card of each pile. (suppose when we put cards on to the piles we put the new ones on top)

            if length==0 or sub[-1]<i:
                sub.append(i)
            else:
                l=0
                r=length
                while l<r:
                    m=(l+r)//2

        return len(sub)
