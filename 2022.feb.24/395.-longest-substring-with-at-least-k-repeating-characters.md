# 395. Longest Substring with At Least K Repeating Characters

* Medium
* Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return _the length of the longest substring of_ `s` _such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to_ `k`.

### Analysis

We solve this problem using a sliding window technique. But since it is hard to see what the limitation here should be, we go through the list 26 times each time limiting the number of different characters in the substring to be constant. Then we compare the maximums calculated by the above 26 passes.&#x20;

            while end < len(s):
                if MoreEqK <= T:
                    s_new = ord(s[end]) - 97
                    freq[s_new] += 1
