# 223. Rectangle Area

* Medium
*   Given the coordinates of two **rectilinear** rectangles in a 2D plane, return _the total area covered by the two rectangles_.

    The first rectangle is defined by its **bottom-left** corner `(ax1, ay1)` and its **top-right** corner `(ax2, ay2)`.

    The second rectangle is defined by its **bottom-left** corner `(bx1, by1)` and its **top-right** corner `(bx2, by2)`.

### Analysis&#x20;

This is actually a pure math problem. We can start by calculating the area of overlap and subtract that from the total area of the two.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def computeArea(self, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H):
        overlap = max(min(C,G)-max(A,E), 0)*max(min(D,H)-max(B,F), 0)
        return (A-C)*(B-D) + (E-G)*(F-H) - overlap
