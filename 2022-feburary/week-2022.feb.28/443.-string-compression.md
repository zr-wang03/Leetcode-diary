# 443. String Compression

* Medium
*   Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it using the following algorithm:

    Begin with an empty string `s`. For each group of **consecutive repeating characters** in `chars`:

    * If the group's length is `1`, append the character to `s`.
    * Otherwise, append the character followed by the group's length.

    The compressed string `s` **should not be returned separately**, but instead, be stored **in the input character array `chars`**. Note that group lengths that are `10` or longer will be split into multiple characters in `chars`.

    After you are done **modifying the input array,** return _the new length of the array_.

    You must write an algorithm that uses only constant extra space.

### Analysis&#x20;

We use two pointers to solve this problem. The slow pointer points to the start of the repeating characters, while the fast one goes to the end of the repeating. When we return slow at the end, we are returning the range that has been seen and modified, the rest of the array hasn't but we don't care about it.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:
        slow, fast = 0, 0
        while fast < len(chars):
		
            chars[slow] = chars[fast]
            count = 1
			
            while fast + 1 < len(chars) and chars[fast] == chars[fast+1]:
                fast+=1
                count+=1
			
            if count > 1:
                for c in str(count):
                    chars[slow+1] = c
                    slow+=1
            
            fast+=1
            slow+=1
        
        return slow
```
