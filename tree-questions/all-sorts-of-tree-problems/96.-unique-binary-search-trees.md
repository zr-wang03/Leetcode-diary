# 96. Unique Binary Search Trees

* Medium
*   Given an integer `n`, return _the number of structurally unique **BST'**s (binary search trees) which has exactly_ `n` _nodes of unique values from_ `1` _to_ `n`.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: n = 3
    Output: 5
    ```

    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: n = 1
    Output: 1
    ```

### Solution&#x20;

We can start by thinking about his as a pure math problem instead of a programming one. Suppose you have n nodes to arrange on a tree, and now you picked an number i to be the root. In this case, the subtree on the left will have (i-1) nodes to arrange, while the subtree on the right will have (n-i) nodes to arrange.&#x20;

Therefore, the number of possible arrangements for a given set of (n,i) is equal to the product of the two values above.&#x20;

This looks like a recursive problem, so we can check what will happen at the end.&#x20;

When there is 0 or 1 nodes to arrange, clearly there is only 1 way to do so. When there is 2 or more, it follows the rule we have given above.&#x20;

Therefore we can construct our list as follows:

```
class Solution:
    def numTrees(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [0]*(n+1)
        dp[0], dp[1] = 1, 1
        for i in range(2, n+1):
            for j in range(1, i+1):
                dp[i] += dp[j-1] * dp[i-j]
        return dp[n]
```
