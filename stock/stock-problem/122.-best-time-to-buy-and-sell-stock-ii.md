# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

* Easy
*   You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.

    Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

    **Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

### Solution (Python)

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (9) (1) (1) (1).png>)

In this solution what we are looking for is local maximums and local minimums, then we buy/sell accordingly. &#x20;

The last 'if' outside the loop is for the case where local maximum falls on the edge of the region.&#x20;

```
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        ans=0
        n=len(prices)
        if n<2:
            return 0
        i=0
        buy=-1
        while i<n-1:
            if buy==-1:
                buy=prices[i]
            if prices[i]<buy:
                buy=prices[i]
            if prices[i]>prices[i+1]:
                ans+=prices[i]-buy
                buy=-1
            i+=1
        if buy!=-1 and prices[n-1]>buy:
            ans+=prices[n-1]-buy
        return ans
```

Another idea, this one uses dynamic planning.&#x20;

current\_hode is the state that we are holding an stock, this can only be resulting from previously holding an stock or buying a stock while previously not holding a stock.&#x20;

The same applies for current\__not_\_hode which is the state where we don't hold any stock.&#x20;

The return value is current\__not\__hode because at the end we should not be holding any stock.&#x20;

```
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        current_hode,current_not_hode=-float('inf'),0
        
        
        for price in prices:
            previous_hode,previous_not_hode=current_hode,current_not_hode
            
            current_hode=max(previous_hode, previous_not_hode-price)
            
            current_not_hode=max(previous_not_hode, previous_hode+price)
            
        return current_not_hode
```





After working on further questions of this type, a more elegant solution came to me.&#x20;

```
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        buy=float('inf')
        sell=0
        for i in prices:
            buy=min(i-sell,buy)
            sell=max(i-buy,sell)
        return sell
```

Before we finished the first transaction, sell=0. Therefore the loop is going as we used to know it with i-sell=i. After finishing the first loop, we would have had a profit, then we can subtract that profit value from the remaining list and then once again look for the lowest point to buy the stock.&#x20;
