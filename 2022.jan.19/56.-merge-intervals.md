# 56. Merge Intervals

* Medium
* Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return _an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input_.

### Analysis&#x20;

If two interval overlaps, then i2\[0]\<i1\[1]. However if we want to do that straight from the start, that would require O(N^2) time complexity. Therefore we try to sort it first and then we only have to compart the adjacent ones.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def merge(self, I):
        I.sort()
        ans = [I[0]]
        for i in I:
            if i[0] <= ans[-1][1]:
                ans[-1][1] = max(ans[-1][1], i[1])
            else:
                ans.append(i)
        return ans
```
