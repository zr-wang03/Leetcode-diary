# 63. Unique Paths II

* Medium
*   A robot is located at the top-left corner of a `m x n` grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

    The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

    Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

    An obstacle and space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

### Analysis&#x20;

The idea is to make a matrix to record how many ways are there to reach the end point from that point. For each point, there are only two options available: to go down or to go right. Therefore, the number of routines for this specfic grid is equal to the sum of the grid lower and the grid to the right.&#x20;

Now we add the obstacle into consideration by making the possible routines for that grid to be 0.&#x20;
