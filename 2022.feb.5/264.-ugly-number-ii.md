# 264. Ugly Number II

* Medium
*   An **ugly number** is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to `2`, `3`, and `5`.

    Given an integer `n`, return _the_ `nth` _**ugly number**_.

### Analysis&#x20;

Note that every ugly number can be calculated by taking a previous ugly number and multiply it by 2,3 or 5. Therefore we can start our DP solution with just 3 variables recording the candidates for multiplying.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n):
        factors, k = [2,3,5], 3
        starts, Numbers = [0] * k, [1]
        for i in range(n-1):
            candidates = [factors[i]*Numbers[starts[i]] for i in range(k)]
            new_num = min(candidates)
            Numbers.append(new_num)
            starts = [starts[i] + (candidates[i] == new_num) for i in range(k)]
        return Numbers[-1]
