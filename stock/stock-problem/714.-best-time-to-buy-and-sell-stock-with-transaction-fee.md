# 714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee

* Medium
*   You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.

    Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

    **Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

### Analysis

This problem is straight forward in our way of thinking. Given that we now have to pay an fee while transacting, our profit will change from sell-buy to sell-buy-fee. The rest of the problem is the same.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:

        buy=float('inf')
        sell=0
        for i in prices:
            buy=min(i-sell,buy)
            sell=max(i-buy-fee,sell)
        return sell
