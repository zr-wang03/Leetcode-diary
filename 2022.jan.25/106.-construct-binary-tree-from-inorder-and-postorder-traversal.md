# 106. Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal

* Medium
* Given two integer arrays `inorder` and `postorder` where `inorder` is the inorder traversal of a binary tree and `postorder` is the postorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return _the binary tree_.

### Analysis&#x20;

The problem is similar as [105.-construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal.md](105.-construct-binary-tree-from-preorder-and-inorder-traversal.md "mention"). The only difference is it changed from preorder to postorder. The essence is the same, however this time the root is at the end of the postorder list. If we go in the opposite order, we would also have to make sure that we are opearting the right side of the tree first.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def buildTree(self, inorder: List[int], postorder: List[int]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if inorder:
            ind=inorder.index(postorder.pop())
            root=TreeNode(inorder[ind])
            root.right=self.buildTree(inorder[ind+1:],postorder)
            root.left=self.buildTree(inorder[:ind],postorder)
            
            return root
```
