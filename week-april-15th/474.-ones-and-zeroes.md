# 474. Ones and Zeroes

* Medium&#x20;
*   You are given an array of binary strings `strs` and two integers `m` and `n`.

    Return _the size of the largest subset of `strs` such that there are **at most** _ `m` __ `0`_'s and_ `n` __ `1`_'s in the subset_.

    A set `x` is a **subset** of a set `y` if all elements of `x` are also elements of `y`.

### Analysis&#x20;

The brute force solution would be to use backtrack. We can check the case for each string whether it is chosen or not. This will give us a O(2^N) solution.&#x20;

So how can we improve that? We solve it using dynamic planning. In the following matrix dp, dp\[i]\[j] represents the largest subset we can have with limits of i zeros and j ones. Each position can be derived from the previous state, dp\[i-zeros]\[j-ones], where zeros is the number of 0s in the current string and ones is the number of 1s.  Either we chose to add the current one, making it dp\[i-zeros]\[j-ones]+1 or we keep it as it is, keeping dp\[i]\[j].&#x20;

                else:
                    ones+=1
            
            for i in range(m,zeros-1,-1):

                for j in range(n,ones-1,-1):
                    dp[i][j]=max(dp[i][j],dp[i-zeros][j-ones]+1);
