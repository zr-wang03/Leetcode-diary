# 151. Reverse Words in a String

* Medium
*   Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

    A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

    Return _a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space._

    **Note** that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

    &#x20;

### Analysis&#x20;

Though it not might be easy to solve using other languages, in python there are so many built-in functions for similar process that we can solve this with one line.&#x20;

        return " ".join(s.split()[::-1])
