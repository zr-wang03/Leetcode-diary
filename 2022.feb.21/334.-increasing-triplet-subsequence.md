# 334. Increasing Triplet Subsequence

* Medium
* Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` _if there exists a triple of indices_ `(i, j, k)` _such that_ `i < j < k` _and_ `nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]`. If no such indices exists, return `false`.

### Analysis&#x20;

In this question, we are only asked to see if there exist sucha subsequence or not. Therefore we can go through the list recording only the ones that has the highest possibility of becoming one of the subsequence. That is keep i and j from the array and update them along the way. If the new value is larger than j, then we have the answer. Else if it is larger than i but not than j, we can change j to this new value because j>this value and therefore there would be a higher possibility that a new number would be smaller than the new value. We treat i in a similar fashion, if the new value is lower than both of them, then change them both.&#x20;

            if i<second and i>first:
                second=i
            if i<first:
                first=i
