# 105. Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal

* Medium
* Given two integer arrays `preorder` and `inorder` where `preorder` is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and `inorder` is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return _the binary tree_.

### Analysis&#x20;

According to the definition of Preorder Traversal, the first item in that list is always the root. And when we go in to the inorder traversal list and search for that node, we would find out that every node to the left of that node is in the left side of the tree. Therefore we can start to divide this problem into a recursive problem.&#x20;

```
class Solution:
    def buildTree(self, preorder: List[int], inorder: List[int]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if inorder:
            ind=inorder.index(preorder.pop(0))
            root=TreeNode(inorder[ind])
            root.left=self.buildTree(preorder, inorder[:ind])
            root.right=self.buildTree(preorder,inorder[ind+1:])
            return root
```
