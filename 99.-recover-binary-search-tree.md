# 99. Recover Binary Search Tree

*   You are given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST), where the values of **exactly** two nodes of the tree were swapped by mistake. _Recover the tree without changing its structure_.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/28/recover1.jpg)

    ```
    Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
    Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
    Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3 makes the BST valid.
    ```

### Solution&#x20;

This problem consist of two parts, first, to point out which two nodes needs to be changed. Second, change them.&#x20;

The first part is not hard, it can be easily achieve by using inorder traversal. If there exist an node whose value is smaller than the previous one, then there is a problem. Then we need to record this node and look for the second node.&#x20;

Therefore, the solution looks like this:

```
class Solution:
    def recoverTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> None:
        
        self.prev, self.first, self.second = None, None, None
        self.dfs(root)
        self.first.val, self.second.val = self.second.val, self.first.val
        
    
    def dfs(self, root):
        if not root:
            return 
        
        self.dfs(root.left)
        if self.prev and self.prev.val >= root.val:
            if not self.first:
                self.first = self.prev 
            self.second = root 
        self.prev = root
        self.dfs(root.right)
```
