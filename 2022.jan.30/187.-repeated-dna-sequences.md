# 187. Repeated DNA Sequences

* Medium
*   The **DNA sequence** is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`.

    * For example, `"ACGAATTCCG"` is a **DNA sequence**.

    When studying **DNA**, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

    Given a string `s` that represents a **DNA sequence**, return all the **`10`-letter-long** sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in **any order**.

### Analysis&#x20;

The idea for this problem is to use a dictionary to record the occurance of each sequence and if it appears twice then add it to the answer.&#x20;

The idea of sliding window comes when I see that there is a fixed sized window, but it doesn't do much then simply slicing the string.&#x20;

            return answer
        
        curr=s[:10]
        seen=collections.defaultdict(int)
        seen[curr]=1
        for i in range(10,n):
            curr=curr[1:]+s[i]
            seen[curr]+=1
            if seen[curr]==2:
                answer.append(curr)
        return answer
