# 396. Rotate Function

* Medium
*   You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.

    Assume `arrk` to be an array obtained by rotating `nums` by `k` positions clock-wise. We define the **rotation function** `F` on `nums` as follow:

    * `F(k) = 0 * arrk[0] + 1 * arrk[1] + ... + (n - 1) * arrk[n - 1].`

    Return _the maximum value of_ `F(0), F(1), ..., F(n-1)`.

    The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a **32-bit** integer.

### Analysis&#x20;

Given the value of A(n) at any time, it is easy for us to calculate the value of A(n+1). Therefore we can simply go through all the values of A(i) and see which one is the maximum.&#x20;

class Solution(object):
    def maxRotateFunction(self, A):
        r = curr = sum(i * j for i,j in enumerate(A))
        s = sum(A)
        k = len(A)
        while A:
            curr += s - A.pop() * k
            r = max(curr, r)
        return r
