# 376. Wiggle Subsequence

* Medium
*   A **wiggle sequence** is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.

    * For example, `[1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]` is a **wiggle sequence** because the differences `(6, -3, 5, -7, 3)` alternate between positive and negative.
    * In contrast, `[1, 4, 7, 2, 5]` and `[1, 7, 4, 5, 5]` are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.

    A **subsequence** is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

    Given an integer array `nums`, return _the length of the longest **wiggle subsequence** of_ `nums`.

### Analysis&#x20;

Below is a DP solution, using high to represent the wiggle sequence to the point with the last one element ending in the higher place.&#x20;

```
class Solution:
    def wiggleMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        dpLow = [1] * n
        dpHigh = [1] * n
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i] > nums[j] and dpHigh[i] < dpLow[j] + 1:
                    dpHigh[i] = dpLow[j] + 1
                elif nums[i] < nums[j] and dpLow[i] < dpHigh[j] + 1:
                    dpLow[i] = dpHigh[j] + 1
        
        return max(dpHigh[n-1], dpLow[n-1])
