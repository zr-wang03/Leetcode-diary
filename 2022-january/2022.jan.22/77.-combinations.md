# 77. Combinations

*   Given two integers `n` and `k`, return _all possible combinations of_ `k` _numbers out of the range_ `[1, n]`.

    You may return the answer in **any order**.

### Analysis&#x20;

We can see that this problem asks us for "all" the combination. Therefore we might be able to solve this using back tracking, and in fact we do.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def combine(self, n: int, k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        ans=[]
        answer=[]
        self.helper(n,k,0,answer,ans)
        return ans
        
        
    def helper(self,n,k,start,answer,ans):
        if k==0:
            #print(answer)
            ans.append(answer)
            #print(ans)
            return 
        for i in range(start+1,n-k+2):
            #Notice here we cannot change the value of answer, what we should be doing is to 
            #pass into the help function the modified argument
            self.helper(n,k-1,i,answer+[i],ans)
            
        return 
```
