# 1817. Finding the Users Active Minutes

* Medium
*   You are given the logs for users' actions on LeetCode, and an integer `k`. The logs are represented by a 2D integer array `logs` where each `logs[i] = [IDi, timei]` indicates that the user with `IDi` performed an action at the minute `timei`.

    **Multiple users** can perform actions simultaneously, and a single user can perform **multiple actions** in the same minute.

    The **user active minutes (UAM)** for a given user is defined as the **number of unique minutes** in which the user performed an action on LeetCode. A minute can only be counted once, even if multiple actions occur during it.

    You are to calculate a **1-indexed** array `answer` of size `k` such that, for each `j` (`1 <= j <= k`), `answer[j]` is the **number of users** whose **UAM** equals `j`.

    Return _the array_ `answer` _as described above_.

class Solution:
    def findingUsersActiveMinutes(self, logs: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[int]:
        d=defaultdict(set)
        for x,t in logs:
            d[x].add(t)
        answer=[0]*k
        for i in d:
            answer[len(d[i])-1]+=1
        return answer
```
