# 872. Leaf-Similar Trees

*   Consider all the leaves of a binary tree, from left to right order, the values of those leaves form a **leaf value sequence**_._

    ![](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/16/tree.png)
* For example, in the given tree above, the leaf value sequence is `(6, 7, 4, 9, 8)`.
* Two binary trees are considered _leaf-similar_ if their leaf value sequence is the same.
* Return `true` if and only if the two given trees with head nodes `root1` and `root2` are leaf-similar.
