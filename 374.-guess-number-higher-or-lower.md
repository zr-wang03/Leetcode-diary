# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

* Easy
*   We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

    I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

    Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

    You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns 3 possible results:

    * `-1`: The number I picked is lower than your guess (i.e. `pick < num`).
    * `1`: The number I picked is higher than your guess (i.e. `pick > num`).
    * `0`: The number I picked is equal to your guess (i.e. `pick == num`).

    Return _the number that I picked_.
* (This is just binary search

```
# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
# def guess(num: int) -> int:

class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        l=0
        r=n
        while l<r:
            m=(l+r)//2
            if guess(m)<0:
                r=m-1
            elif guess(m)>0:
                l=m+1
            else:
                return m
        return l
```

### Solution (C)

```
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is lower than the guess number
 *			      1 if num is higher than the guess number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * int guess(int num);
