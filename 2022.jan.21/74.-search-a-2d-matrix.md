# 74. Search a 2D Matrix

* Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an `m x n` matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
  * Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
  * The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

### Analysis

From the descriptions we can see that the matrix is alreay sorted. If we make it one dimension by linking the rows one by one, we would have a sorted array. So our job is to do binary search in that linear array.&#x20;

However, pulling it into a linear array would require much time. What we do is to use mathematics and mimic what it would be like if we have made it one dimensional.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix: List[List[int]], target: int) -> bool:
        if not matrix or not matrix[0]: return False
        m=len(matrix)
        n=len(matrix[0])
        l,r=0,m*n-1
        
        while l<r:
            mid=(l+r)//2
            find=matrix[mid//n][mid%n]
            if find<target:
                l=mid+1
            elif find>target:
                r=mid-1
            else:
                return True
        return matrix[l//n][l%n]==target
```
