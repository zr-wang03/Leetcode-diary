# 98. Validate Binary Search Tree

* Given the `root` of a binary tree, _determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST)_.
*   A **valid BST** is defined as follows:

    * The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
    * The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
    * Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

    **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree1.jpg)

    ```
    Input: root = [2,1,3]
    Output: true
    ```

    **Example 2:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/tree2.jpg)

    ```
    Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
    Output: false
    Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
    ```



### Solution&#x20;

When we look at this question, the first thing that comes to mind is an inorder traversal. If the tree is valid, then the result from travesal must be in a perfect ascending order.&#x20;

Now how to the order? It is simple to do so with the help of 'sorted', if we have the sequence sorted and compare it to the orginal one, we will get the same thing if the orginal sequence follows ascending order, otherwise we will end up with different sequences.&#x20;

Therefore our first version of code looks like this.&#x20;

```
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        resp,stack=[],[]
        while root or stack:
            if root:
                stack.append(root)
                root=root.left
            else:
                node=stack.pop()
                resp.append(node.val)
                root=node.right
        
        d=resp.copy()
        d=sorted(d)
        if d==resp:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

While testing this code, I figured out that there are samples like this.&#x20;

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (5) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

Our solution could not handle this because when we sort it, it will not change and we will get the same result. However, this sequence is not considered validate. Therefore we can add a step to judge if all the values in the list are different. Since we have already put the list into order, we only have to check each value with the one before.&#x20;

So here is our second code.&#x20;

```
class Solution:
    def isValidBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        resp,stack=[],[]
        while root or stack:
            if root:
                stack.append(root)
                root=root.left
            else:
                node=stack.pop()
                resp.append(node.val)
                root=node.right
        
        d=resp.copy()
        d=sorted(d)
        if d==resp:
            flag=[]
            for i in d:
                if flag==i:
                    return False
                flag=i
            return True
        else:
            return False
```
