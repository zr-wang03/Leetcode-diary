# 241. Different Ways to Add Parentheses

* Medium
* Given a string `expression` of numbers and operators, return _all possible results from computing all the different possible ways to group numbers and operators_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

### Analysis&#x20;

This can be solved using the strategy called "Divide and Conquer". It is basically the same as recursion, spliting the problem into smaller parts and solve them one by one.&#x20;

The idea in the question is that we know how to deal with the situation where there is only one symbol ("+-\*"), so what we are going to do is to split this problem up until we have sub-problems where there is only one symbol in it.&#x20;

The first version looks like this. It goes out of the time limit because it has been doing repetitive work over and over again. We will solve this in the second round.&#x20;

```
class Solution:
    def diffWaysToCompute(self, expression: str) -> List[int]:
        if expression.isdigit():
            return [int(expression)]
        
        res=[]
        for i in range(len(expression)):
            v=expression[i]

                
            left_res=self.diffWaysToCompute(expression[:i])
            right_res=self.diffWaysToCompute(expression[i+1:])
            for l in left_res:
                for r in right_res:
                    if v=="+":
                        res.append(l+r)
                    if v=="*":
                        res.append(l*r)
                    if v=="-":
                        res.append(l-r)
        return res
```

To solve the problem mentioned above, we need to add something to remeber the calculations we have done.&#x20;

        return self.diffWaysToComputeUtil(expression)
        
        
    def diffWaysToComputeUtil(self, expression: str) -> List[int]:
        if expression in self.memo:
            return self.memo[expression]
        
        if expression.isdigit():
            return [int(expression)]
        
        res = []
        
        for i in range(len(expression)):
            v=expression[i]
            if not v.isdigit():
                left_res = self.diffWaysToComputeUtil(expression[:i])
                right_res = self.diffWaysToComputeUtil(expression[i + 1:])
                for left_v in left_res:
                    for right_v in right_res:
                        if v == '+':
                            res.append(left_v + right_v)
                        elif v == '-':
                            res.append(left_v - right_v)
                        else:
                            res.append(left_v * right_v)
        self.memo[expression] = res
        return res
```
