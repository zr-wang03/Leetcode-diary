# 179. Largest Number

* Medium
*   Given a list of non-negative integers `nums`, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.

    Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

### Analysis&#x20;

The core of the problem is sorting, but the rule for comparing is a little different. For example if we have 30 and 3, we don't want 30 to be in front of 3 just because 30>3. What we want is 3 before 30 because "330">"303". Therefore we need to compare the string created by arranging them with different order.&#x20;

    def largestNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> str:
        n=len(nums)
        for i in range(n-1):
            for j in range(n-i-1):
                if str(nums[j])+str(nums[j+1])<str(nums[j+1])+str(nums[j]):
                    nums[j],nums[j+1]=nums[j+1],nums[j]
            #print(nums)
        ans=""
        for i in range(n):
            ans+=str(nums[i])
        if ans[0]=="0":
            return "0"
        return ans
```
