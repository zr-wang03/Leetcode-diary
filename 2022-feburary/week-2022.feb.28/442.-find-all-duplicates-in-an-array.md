# 442. Find All Duplicates in an Array

* Medium
*   Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where all the integers of `nums` are in the range `[1, n]` and each integer appears **once** or **twice**, return _an array of all the integers that appears **twice**_.

    You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses only constant extra space.

### Analysis&#x20;

We know we have n numbers that falls in the range \[1,n] and some of them appears twice. That means if we puts them into an array according to their value, there would be a few that is not in space. If that happens, we would know that those out of their place are the ones that appeared twice.&#x20;

    def findDuplicates(self, nums):
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            while i != nums[i] - 1 and nums[i] != nums[nums[i]-1]:
                nums[nums[i]-1], nums[i]=nums[i], nums[nums[i]-1]
                
        return [nums[it] for it in range(len(nums)) if it != nums[it] - 1]
