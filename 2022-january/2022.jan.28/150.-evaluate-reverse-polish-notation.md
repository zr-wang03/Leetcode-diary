# 150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

* Medium
*   Evaluate the value of an arithmetic expression in [Reverse Polish Notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse\_Polish\_notation).

    Valid operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. Each operand may be an integer or another expression.

    **Note** that division between two integers should truncate toward zero.

    It is guaranteed that the given RPN expression is always valid. That means the expression would always evaluate to a result, and there will not be any division by zero operation.

### Analyze&#x20;

Accroding to the given definition, the RPN is different in that the "+-\*/" symbols come after the numbers. Therefore a stack would come into great use in this scenario.&#x20;

class Solution(object):
    def evalRPN(self, tokens):
        stack = []
        for t in tokens:
            if t not in "+-*/":
                stack.append(int(t))
            else:
                r, l = stack.pop(), stack.pop()
                if t == "+":
                    stack.append(l+r)
                elif t == "-":
                    stack.append(l-r)
                elif t == "*":
                    stack.append(l*r)
                else:
                    stack.append(int(float(l)/r))
        return stack.pop()
```
