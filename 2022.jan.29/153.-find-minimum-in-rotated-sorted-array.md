# 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

* Medium
*   Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

    * `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
    * `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

    Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

    Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return _the minimum element of this array_.

    You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time.`

### Analysis&#x20;

O (log n) reminds us that we need to do this with binary search. However this time we don't have a target to look for, so let's see how the normal ifs would do in this situation.&#x20;

If nums\[mid]>nums\[right], this tells us that the list is not strictly ascending from mid to right, therefore the pivot would be within that section.&#x20;

Therefore the same applies when nums\[mid]\<nums\[left]. And now we have a binary search to write.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        left,right=0,len(nums)-1
        while left<right:
            mid=(left+right)//2
            if nums[mid]>nums[right]:
                left=mid+1
            else:
                right=mid
        return nums[left]
```
