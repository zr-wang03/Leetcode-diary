# 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

* Medium
*   There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [xstart, xend]` denotes a balloon whose **horizontal diameter** stretches between `xstart` and `xend`. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

    Arrows can be shot up **directly vertically** (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with `xstart` and `xend` is **burst** by an arrow shot at `x` if `xstart <= x <= xend`. There is **no limit** to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

    Given the array `points`, return _the **minimum** number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons_.

### Analysis&#x20;

The greedy solution is possible in this case. First we sort the ballons by the end points. Then starting from the first balloon, we check if it is taken care of by the previous arrows. If not, we shoot an arrow to the end of that ballon.&#x20;

```
class Solution(object):
    def findMinArrowShots(self, points):
        points.sort(key=lambda p: p[1])
        ans, arrow = 0, 0
        for [start, end] in points:
            if ans == 0 or start > arrow:
                ans, arrow = ans + 1, end
        return ans
```
