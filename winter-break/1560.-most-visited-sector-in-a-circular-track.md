# 1560. Most Visited Sector in a Circular Track

* Easy
*   Given an integer `n` and an integer array `rounds`. We have a circular track which consists of `n` sectors labeled from `1` to `n`. A marathon will be held on this track, the marathon consists of `m` rounds. The `ith` round starts at sector `rounds[i - 1]` and ends at sector `rounds[i]`. For example, round 1 starts at sector `rounds[0]` and ends at sector `rounds[1]`

    Return _an array of the most visited sectors_ sorted in **ascending** order.
* Notice that you circulate the track in ascending order of sector numbers in the counter-clockwise direction (See the first example).
* (I must say that this is not an algorithm question at all

### Solution (Python)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

```
class Solution:
    def mostVisited(self, n: int, rounds: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        return range(rounds[0],rounds[-1]+1) or list(range(1,rounds[-1]+1)) + list(range(rounds[0],n+1)) 
```

Actually the only thing we care about is the beginning and ending point of this list. The other points are irrelvant since they are just iterating around the circle path.&#x20;

### Solution (C)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (6) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

```
void *cmpfunc(void *a, void *b){
    return (*(int*)a - *(int*)b);
}

/**
 * Note: The returned array must be malloced, assume caller calls free().
 */
int* mostVisited(int n, int* rounds, int roundsSize, int* returnSize){
    int* answer=(int*) malloc(sizeof(int)*(n+1));
    int count=1;
    int pos=rounds[0];
    int end=rounds[roundsSize-1];
    answer[0]=pos;
    while (pos!=end)
    {
        pos=pos%n;
        pos+=1;
        answer[count]=pos;
        count+=1;

    }
    qsort(answer, count, sizeof(int), cmpfunc);
    *returnSize = count;
    return answer;
}
```

Since we don't know how much space we would be using, we have to plan for the worst when using malloc. The first pos is assigned outside the loop to prevent problems with the same beginning and ending points.&#x20;
