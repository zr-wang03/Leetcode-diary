# 62. Unique Paths

* Medium
*   There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

    Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

    The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 10^9`.

### Analysis&#x20;

The question is a mathematic problem. If the grid is m\*n, then we need (m-1) horizontal steps and (n-1) vertical steps to go to the end. The question is asking for total possibilities, that is the same as asking how many possible ways are there to put (n-1) items into a list of (m+n-2) items.&#x20;

That would be equal to C(n-1)  (m+n-2)

```
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        k=min(m-1,n-1)
        l=m+n-2
        ans=1
        for i in range(1,k+1):
            print(l-i+1,i)
            ans=ans*(l-i+1)
            ans=ans/i
        return int(ans)
```



or by taking advantage of Python's functions, but the idea is the same&#x20;

```
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
        return factorial(m+n-2) // factorial(m-1) // factorial(n-1)
```
