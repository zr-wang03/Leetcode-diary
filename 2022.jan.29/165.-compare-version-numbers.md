# 165. Compare Version Numbers

* Medium
*   Given two version numbers, `version1` and `version2`, compare them.

    * Version numbers consist of **one or more revisions** joined by a dot `'.'`. Each revision consists of **digits** and may contain leading **zeros**. Every revision contains **at least one character**. Revisions are **0-indexed from left to right**, with the leftmost revision being revision 0, the next revision being revision 1, and so on. For example `2.5.33` and `0.1` are valid version numbers.

    To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in **left-to-right order**. Revisions are compared using their **integer value ignoring any leading zeros**. This means that revisions `1` and `001` are considered **equal**. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then **treat the revision as `0`**. For example, version `1.0` is less than version `1.1` because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are `0` and `1` respectively, and `0 < 1`.

    _Return the following:_

    * If `version1 < version2`, return `-1`.
    * If `version1 > version2`, return `1`.
    * Otherwise, return `0`.



### Analysis&#x20;

The built-in function "split" in python helps to save time in the solution, but it is still easy to do the same thing with out it. The idea is to create to list of seperate parts in each version and compare them one by one.&#x20;

```
class Solution:
    def compareVersion(self, version1: str, version2: str) -> int:
        v1=[int(v) for v in version1.split(".")]
        v2=[int(v) for v in version2.split(".")]
        
        for i in range(max(len(v1),len(v2))):
            if i<len(v1):
                l1=v1[i]
            else:
                l1=0
            if i<len(v2):
                l2=v2[i]
            else:
                l2=0
            if l1<l2:
                return -1
            if l1>l2:
                return 1
        return 0
```
