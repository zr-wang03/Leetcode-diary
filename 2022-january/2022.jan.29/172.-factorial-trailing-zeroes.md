# 172. Factorial Trailing Zeroes

* Medium
*   Given an integer `n`, return _the number of trailing zeroes in_ `n!`.

    Note that `n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 3 * 2 * 1`.

### Analysis&#x20;

This is a pure math problem, the number of mutliples of 5^n in the calculation determines how many zeroes there would be. Therefore we can first calculate how many multiples of 5 are there, then 25, then 125. And the eaiest way to do that, is through recursion.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def trailingZeroes(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n==0:
            return 0
        return n//5+self.trailingZeroes(n//5)
```
