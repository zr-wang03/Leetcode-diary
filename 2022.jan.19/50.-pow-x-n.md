# 50. Pow(x, n)

* Medium&#x20;
* Implement [pow(x, n)](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/valarray/pow/), which calculates `x` raised to the power `n` (i.e., `xn`).

### Analysis&#x20;

There are a two special case: n is negative and n=0. If n=0, we return 0. If n is negative, we calculate the value to -n times and divide it by 1.&#x20;

The first idea is just to use a for loop to calculated x\*x n times. Therotically it is not wrong, but it would not pass the time limit in some cases.&#x20;

Therefore the second idea is using recursion. A power calculation like 2^50 can be separated in to (2^25)\*(2^25). Now 2^25 can be separated into (2^12)\*(2^12)\*2.&#x20;

Eventually when we have 2^0, we return 1.&#x20;

            return 1 / self.helper(a, -b)
        else:
            return self.helper(a, b)
    
    def helper(self, a, b):
        if b == 0: return 1
        half = self.helper(a, b // 2)
        if b % 2 == 0:
            return half * half
        else:
            return half * half * a
