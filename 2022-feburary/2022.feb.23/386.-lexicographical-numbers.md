# 386. Lexicographical Numbers

* Medium
*   Given an integer `n`, return all the numbers in the range `[1, n]` sorted in lexicographical order.

    You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses `O(1)` extra space.&#x20;

### Analysis&#x20;

What we want is something like 1, 10, 11, 12... Therefore we can build the algorithm based on that idea.&#x20;

```
class Solution(object):
    def lexicalOrder(self, n):
        ans = [1]
        while len(ans) < n:
            new = ans[-1] * 10
            while new > n:
                new=int(new // 10)
                new += 1
                while new % 10 == 0:    # deal with case like 199+1=200 when we need to restart from 2.
                    new=int(new/10)
            ans.append(new)    
        return ans
```
