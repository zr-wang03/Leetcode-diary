# 89. Gray Code

* Medium
*   An **n-bit gray code sequence** is a sequence of `2n` integers where:

    * Every integer is in the **inclusive** range `[0, 2n - 1]`,
    * The first integer is `0`,
    * An integer appears **no more than once** in the sequence,
    * The binary representation of every pair of **adjacent** integers differs by **exactly one bit**, and
    * The binary representation of the **first** and **last** integers differs by **exactly one bit**.

    Given an integer `n`, return _any valid **n-bit gray code sequence**_.

### Analysis&#x20;

We try to look for the cules in this thing:

```
0    11    110
1    10    111
           101
           100     
```

The above is the answer for n=3. Now what can we see from this? We start with an 0, and the other number that can be diplayed with one digit is 1. Then we go on to 2 digits, notices that the second digit comes in the sequence of "1"=>"0".&#x20;

Then we go to 3 digits. Now it is clearer, we look at the two digits in the back and we see "10"=>"11"=>"01'=> "00". So what is this? This is actually the reversed order of numbers already in the sequence + a digit infront. (To be clear the number already in the sequnence is "0 1 11 10")

Therefore we can build our code step by step, each step deal with numbers up to i digits.&#x20;
