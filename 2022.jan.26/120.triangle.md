# 120.Triangle

* Medium
*   Given a `triangle` array, return _the minimum path sum from top to bottom_.

    For each step, you may move to an adjacent number of the row below. More formally, if you are on index `i` on the current row, you may move to either index `i` or index `i + 1` on the next row.

    &#x20;

    **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: triangle = [[2],[3,4],[6,5,7],[4,1,8,3]]
    Output: 11
    Explanation: The triangle looks like:
       2
      3 4
     6 5 7
    4 1 8 3
    The minimum path sum from top to bottom is 2 + 3 + 5 + 1 = 11 (underlined above).
    ```

    \


### Analysis&#x20;

This is an example of a recursion problem. We can start to work from the bottom to the top. From the second bottom row to the top row, the path sum needed to go from the bottom to that top is equal to its own value plus the smaller of the two path sums of the two nodes just below it.&#x20;

Therefore we can alternate on the orginal tree and follow that rule.&#x20;

        n=len(triangle)
        for i in reversed(range(n-1)):
            for j in range(len(triangle[i])):
                triangle[i][j]+=min(triangle[i+1][j],triangle[i+1][j+1])
            #print(triangle[i])
        return triangle[0][0]
```
