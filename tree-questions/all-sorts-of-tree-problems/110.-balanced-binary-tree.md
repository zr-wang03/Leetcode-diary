# 110. Balanced Binary Tree

* Easy
* Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.
*   For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

    > a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of _every_ node differ in height by no more than 1.

            if not root:
                return 0

            if abs(left-right)>1:
                return -1
            
            return max(left,right)+1
        return check(root)!=-1
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This solution uses recursive method but built a path for any imbalance to transmit immidiately back. Therefore it saves more time than the other soutions.&#x20;
