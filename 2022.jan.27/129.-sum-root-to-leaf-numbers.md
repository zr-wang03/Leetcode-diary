# 129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers

* Medium
*   You are given the `root` of a binary tree containing digits from `0` to `9` only.

    Each root-to-leaf path in the tree represents a number.

    * For example, the root-to-leaf path `1 -> 2 -> 3` represents the number `123`.

    Return _the total sum of all root-to-leaf numbers_. Test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

    A **leaf** node is a node with no children.

### Analysis&#x20;

This problem can be solved as a back-tracking problem, we go through every possibilities and add them up when we meet the leaf.&#x20;

        answer=0
        current=0
        answer=self.helper(root,current)
        return answer
    
    def helper(self,root,current):
        if not root:
            return 0
        if not root.right and not root.left:
            return current*10+root.val
        
        return self.helper(root.left, current*10+root.val)+self.helper(root.right, current*10+root.val)
