# 152. Maximum Product Subarray

* Medium
*   Given an integer array `nums`, find a contiguous non-empty subarray within the array that has the largest product, and return _the product_.

    The test cases are generated so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

    A **subarray** is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

### Analysis&#x20;

This can be solved using dynamic planning. We would like to keep 3 indicators, the first one being the current value, that is going to be useful if the previous value was 0. The second one should be the lowest the third one would be the maximum. Those two are interchangeable because as soon as we meet a negative number, the minimum becomes the maximum and the maximum becomes the minimum.&#x20;

    def maxProduct(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        curMax, curMin = 1, 1
        res = nums[0]
        
        for n in nums:
            vals = (n, n * curMax, n * curMin)
            curMax, curMin = max(vals), min(vals)
			
            res = max(res, curMax)
            
        return res
```
