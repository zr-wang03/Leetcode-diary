# 525. Contiguous Array

* Medium
* Given a binary array `nums`, return _the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of_ `0` _and_ `1`.

### Analysis

The idea is similar to [1624.-largest-substring-between-two-equal-characters.md](1624.-largest-substring-between-two-equal-characters.md "mention"). We can build a counter such that it increases by one when nums is 1, decrease by one when nums is 0. When the counter reaches some value it has seen before, then the list betweeen would be an subarray we are looking for.&#x20;

    def findMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        seen={0:-1}
        curr=0
        maxi=0
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i]==0:
                curr-=1
            else:
                curr+=1
            if curr in seen:
                maxi=max(maxi,i-seen[curr])
            else:
                seen[curr]=i
        print(seen)
        return maxi
