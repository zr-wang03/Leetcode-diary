# 435. Non-overlapping Intervals

* Medium
* Given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, return _the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping_.

### Analysis&#x20;

Here a greedy solution is applicable. After we sort the intervals, we save the ones with ealier end time and remove the ones with later end time. That will make sure that we can keep as much non-overlap interval as possible, which is also the same as using removing as few non-overlapping interval as possible.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def eraseOverlapIntervals(self, intervals: List[List[int]]) -> int:

        end, cnt = float('-inf'), 0
        for s, e in sorted(intervals, key=lambda x: x[1]):
            if s >= end: 
                end = e
            else: 
                cnt += 1
        return cnt
```
