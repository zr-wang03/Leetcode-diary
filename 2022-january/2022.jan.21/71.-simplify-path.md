# 71. Simplify Path

* Medium
*   Given a string `path`, which is an **absolute path** (starting with a slash `'/'`) to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system, convert it to the simplified **canonical path**.

    In a Unix-style file system, a period `'.'` refers to the current directory, a double period `'..'` refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. `'//'`) are treated as a single slash `'/'`. For this problem, any other format of periods such as `'...'` are treated as file/directory names.

    The **canonical path** should have the following format:

    * The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.
    * Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.
    * The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.
    * The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`)

    Return _the simplified **canonical path**_.

### Analysis&#x20;

So when we look at this question and how some of the paths will be read and treated or ignored and deleted, the idea of stack should come to mind.&#x20;

    def simplifyPath(self, path):
        stack = []
        for element in path.split("/"):
            if stack and element == "..":
                stack.pop()
            elif element not in [".", "", ".."]:
                stack.append(element)
                
        return "/" + "/".join(stack)
```
