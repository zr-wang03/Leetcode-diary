# 198. House Robber

* Medium
*   You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

    Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

### Analysis

For the robber, whenever he comes to an house, there is two options for him, rob, or not rob. Therefore this is a DP problem.&#x20;

Since the robber always earn something when rob a house, XâˆšX is always better than XXX no matter if the robber is planning on robbing the other houses apart from the three. Therefore, when we think about a house, we only consider two house before that. The houses further before would not have any effect on our decision.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        currmax=0
        n=len(nums)
        if n<2:
            return nums[0]
        
        rob=[0]*n
        non=[0]*n
        rob[0]=nums[0]
        rob[1]=nums[1]
        
        for i in range(1,n):
            if i>=2:
                rob[i]=max(rob[i-2]+nums[i],non[i-1]+nums[i])
            else:
                rob[i]=nums[i]
            non[i]=max(rob[i-1],non[i-1])
            
        return max(rob[n-1],non[n-1])
```

A very concise method looks like the following.&#x20;

```
class Solution:
    def rob(self, A):
        prev2, prev, cur = 0,0,0
        for i in A:
            cur = max(prev, i + prev2)
            prev2 = prev
            prev = cur
        return cur
```
