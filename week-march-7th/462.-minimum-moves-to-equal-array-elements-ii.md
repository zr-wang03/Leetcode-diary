# 462. Minimum Moves to Equal Array Elements II

* Medium
* Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, return _the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal_.
* In one move, you can increment or decrement an element of the array by `1`.
* Test cases are designed so that the answer will fit in a **32-bit** integer.

### Analysis&#x20;

We want to find the median value and then make the other numbers change into that median value. Therefore we just need to sort the array and then we will have the median as we want.&#x20;

```
class Solution:
    def minMoves2(self, nums):
        median = sorted(nums)[len(nums)//2]
        return sum(abs(num - median) for num in nums)
```
