# 82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II

* Medium
*   Given the `head` of a sorted linked list, _delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list_. Return _the linked list **sorted** as well_.

    &#x20;
*   **Example 1:**

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/linkedlist1.jpg)

    ```
    Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
    Output: [1,2,5]
    ```



### Analysis&#x20;

This is a linked list problem. And when solving linked list problems, pointers always come in handy. In this problem, we are creating a pointer that is faster than the other one and is continus moving. If this pointer reaches duplicates, the other pointer is then used to skip those duplicates.&#x20;

```
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy=ans=ListNode(0)
        dummy.next=head
        while head and head.next:
            if head.val==head.next.val:
                while head.next and head.val==head.next.val:
                    head=head.next
                head=head.next
                dummy.next=head
                #dummy=dummy.next

            else:
                dummy.next=head
                dummy=dummy.next
                head=head.next
        return ans.next
```
