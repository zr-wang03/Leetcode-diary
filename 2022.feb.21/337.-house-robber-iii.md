# 337. House Robber III

* Medium
*   The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called `root`.

    Besides the `root`, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if **two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night**.

    Given the `root` of the binary tree, return _the maximum amount of money the thief can rob **without alerting the police**_.

### Analysis&#x20;

This is another DP problem as any of the other "House Robber" problems. Since only the direct linked ones will trigger a alarm, there is no meaning in leaving two houses in a row without robbing any of them. Therefore the value of rob and dont\_rob can be calculated and compared.&#x20;

    def rob(self, root):
        if not root: return 0
        dont_rob, rob_root = self.rob(root.left) + self.rob(root.right), root.val
        if root.left:   rob_root += self.rob(root.left.left)  + self.rob(root.left.right)
        if root.right:  rob_root += self.rob(root.right.left) + self.rob(root.right.right)
        return max(dont_rob, rob_root)
```
