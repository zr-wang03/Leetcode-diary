# 406. Queue Reconstruction by Height

* Medium
*   You are given an array of people, `people`, which are the attributes of some people in a queue (not necessarily in order). Each `people[i] = [hi, ki]` represents the `ith` person of height `hi` with **exactly** `ki` other people in front who have a height greater than or equal to `hi`.

    Reconstruct and return _the queue that is represented by the input array_ `people`. The returned queue should be formatted as an array `queue`, where `queue[j] = [hj, kj]` is the attributes of the `jth` person in the queue (`queue[0]` is the person at the front of the queue).

### Analysis&#x20;

The idea is simple. First we sort the tallest group of people, they would be sorted by the "k" value. Then we sort the second tallest group, inserting them into the queue according to the k value. Then we keep repeating it.&#x20;

class Solution(object):
    def reconstructQueue(self, people):

        people = sorted(people, key = lambda x: (-x[0], x[1]))
        res = []
        for p in people:
            res.insert(p[1], p)
        return res
```
