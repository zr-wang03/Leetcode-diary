# 419. Battleships in a Board

* Medium
*   Given an `m x n` matrix `board` where each cell is a battleship `'X'` or empty `'.'`, return _the number of the **battleships** on_ `board`.

    **Battleships** can only be placed horizontally or vertically on `board`. In other words, they can only be made of the shape `1 x k` (`1` row, `k` columns) or `k x 1` (`k` rows, `1` column), where `k` can be of any size. At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships (i.e., there are no adjacent battleships).

### Analysis&#x20;

There is a little trick to this question. We don't need to find all the spots that is occupied by a "battleship", we just need a top left "x" to say we have found a ship.&#x20;

class Solution(object):
    def countBattleships(self, board):
        if len(board) == 0: return 0
        m, n = len(board), len(board[0])
        count = 0
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if board[i][j] == 'X' and (i == 0 or board[i-1][j] == '.') and (j == 0 or board[i][j-1] == '.'):
                    count += 1
        return count
```
