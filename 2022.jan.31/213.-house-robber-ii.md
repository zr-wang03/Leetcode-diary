# 213. House Robber II

* Medium
* You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.
* Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return _the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**_.

### Analysis&#x20;

This question can be seen as a follow up question on [198.-house-robber.md](../winter-break/198.-house-robber.md "mention"). We can solve this problem by spliting it into two parts: rob\[0:n-1] or rob \[1:n].&#x20;

    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

            dp, dp1, dp2 = 0, 0, 0
            for i in range(left, right+1):
                dp = max(dp1, dp2 + nums[i])
                dp2 = dp1
                dp1 = dp
            return dp1
        
        n = len(nums)
        if n == 1: return nums[0]
        return max(solve(0, n-2), solve(1, n-1))
