# 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

* Medium
*   You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.

    Return _the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations_.

### Analysis&#x20;

It seems clear that this is a problem for sliding window. But the difficult part is how wide should the window be. The answer is the length has to be smaller than the sum of the maximum occurance of one character in the window + the time k we have to operate. That is to say we want length\<maxi+k.&#x20;

        for fast in range(len(s)):
            j=ord(s[fast])-ord("A")
            count[j]+=1
            maxi=max(maxi,count[j])
            if maxi+k<fast-slow+1:
                count[ord(s[slow])-ord("A")]-=1
                slow+=1
        return len(s)-slow
