# 109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree

* Medium
*   Given the `head` of a singly linked list where elements are **sorted in ascending order**, convert it to a height balanced BST.

    For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of _every_ node never differ by more than 1.

### Analysis&#x20;

To build a binary search tree takes the same method we have used in solving [108.-convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree.md](../tree-questions/all-sorts-of-tree-problems/108.-convert-sorted-array-to-binary-search-tree.md "mention"). However, in that question we were given a list, but now we are given an linked list.&#x20;

The most naive idea is to transform that linked list into a list and pass it into the function of 108.&#x20;

```
class Solution:
    def sortedListToBST(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        nums=[]
        while head:
            nums.append(head.val)
            head=head.next
        #print(nums)
        return self.sortedArrayToBST(nums)
            
            
    def sortedArrayToBST(self, nums: List[int]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if len(nums)==0:
            return 
        mid=len(nums)//2
        root = TreeNode(nums[mid])
        
        root.left=self.sortedArrayToBST(nums[0:mid])
        root.right=self.sortedArrayToBST(nums[mid+1:])
        return root
```

But the better way is to use the linked list all the way. To find the middle node in this case would require two pointers, one moving at 2 places each time and the other one moves at 1 place each time. Then when the faster one reaches the end, the slower one would be at the middle node.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def sortedListToBST(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not head:
            return 
        if not head.next:
            return TreeNode(head.val)
        slow,fast=head, head.next.next
        while fast and fast.next:
            fast=fast.next.next
            slow=slow.next
        temp=slow.next
        slow.next=None 
        root=TreeNode(temp.val)
        root.left=self.sortedListToBST(head)
        root.right=self.sortedListToBST(temp.next)
        return root
```
