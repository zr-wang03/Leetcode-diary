# 433. Minimum Genetic Mutation

* Medium
*   A gene string can be represented by an 8-character long string, with choices from `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`.

    Suppose we need to investigate a mutation from a gene string `start` to a gene string `end` where one mutation is defined as one single character changed in the gene string.

    * For example, `"AACCGGTT" --> "AACCGGTA"` is one mutation.

    There is also a gene bank `bank` that records all the valid gene mutations. A gene must be in `bank` to make it a valid gene string.

    Given the two gene strings `start` and `end` and the gene bank `bank`, return _the minimum number of mutations needed to mutate from_ `start` _to_ `end`. If there is no such a mutation, return `-1`.

    Note that the starting point is assumed to be valid, so it might not be included in the bank.

    &#x20;

### Analysis&#x20;

This is a solution using the bfs method. Once we meet one combination in the bank, we would not want to meet it again so we would remove it from the bank.&#x20;

        queue = []
        queue.append((start,0))

                    mutation = curr[:i] + c + curr[i+1:]
                    if mutation in bankSet:
                        bankSet.remove(mutation)
                        queue.append((mutation,step+1))
