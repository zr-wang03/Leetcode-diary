# 117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II

* Medium
*   Given a binary tree

    ```
    struct Node {
      int val;
      Node *left;
      Node *right;
      Node *next;
    }
    ```

    Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

    Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

### Analysis&#x20;

The difference between this question and [116.-populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node.md](116.-populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node.md "mention") is that in this tree it might not be perfectly balanced. However such a problem has already been taken care of in that question's solution so we can apply it once again.&#x20;

                prev=node

            
        return root
