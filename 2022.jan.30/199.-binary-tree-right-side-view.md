# 199. Binary Tree Right Side View

* Medium
*   Given the `root` of a binary tree, imagine yourself standing on the **right side** of it, return _the values of the nodes you can see ordered from top to bottom_.

    ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/14/tree.jpg)

    ```
    Input: root = [1,2,3,null,5,null,4]
    Output: [1,3,4]
    ```



### Analysis&#x20;

The problem in this question is that sometimes the tree is not balanced and the right branch is shorter than the left one. Therefore we cannot just go right and right and right.

The easiest and safest way to solve this is by going over every level. The right most node in each level is our answer.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def rightSideView(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
        if not root:
            return []
        level=[root]
        ans=[]
        next_level=[]
        while level:
            ans.append(level[-1].val)
            for i in level:
                if i.left:
                    next_level.append(i.left)
                if i.right:
                    next_level.append(i.right)
            level=next_level
            next_level=[]
        return ans
```
