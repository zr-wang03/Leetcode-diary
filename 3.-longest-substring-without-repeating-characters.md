# 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

* Medium
* Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

### Analysis

We can create a dictionary to record the last time a character appears in the string. Then when we see a new character, we check if it is in the dictionary, if it is, then the current string will have to be shortened by moving its head to the place after the first appearance of that character. However, if the head is already after that place, it means that our current string doesn't contain that character, we will not change the head.&#x20;

        ans=0
        seen={}
        l,r=0,0
        n=len(s)
        while r<n:
            if s[r] in seen:
                l=max(l,seen[s[r]]+1)
            seen[s[r]]=r
            ans=max(ans,r-l+1)
            r+=1
        return ans
