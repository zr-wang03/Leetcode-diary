# 43. Multiply Strings

* Medium
*   Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represented as strings, return the product of `num1` and `num2`, also represented as a string.

    **Note:** You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

### Analysis&#x20;

The idea here is similar to long multiplication.&#x20;

We create a list called result to record each digit in the answer. Then we calculate each mutiplication and does the carry-on along with our calculation.&#x20;

But we need to remeber that this list, since it is calculated in this order, contains the reversed order of the real answer. Therefore we need to find the 0s at the front of the answer and then reversed the remaining part, that gives us the answer.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def multiply(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        dig=len(num1)+len(num2)
        result=[0]*(dig)
        pos=0
        for i in reversed(num1):
            temp=pos
            pos+=1
            for j in reversed(num2):
                result[temp]+=int(i)*int(j)
                result[temp+1]+=result[temp]//10
                result[temp]=result[temp]%10
                temp+=1
        realdig=dig-1
        while realdig>0 and result[realdig]==0:
            realdig-=1
        ans=""
        #print(realdig)
        #print(result)
        for i in reversed(range(realdig+1)):
            #print(result[i])
            ans+=str(result[i])
        return ans
```
