# 11. Container With Most Water

* Medium
*   You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `ith` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

    Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

    Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store_.

    **Notice** that you may not slant the container.

### Analysis

The first and the last height is a good starting point in this problem because they have the largest width in between. Then we see how we can improve that.&#x20;

For each set of left and right endpoints, there is a lower one of them. If we try to change that lower one, we might be able to reach a better result. By contrast, if we change the longer one, then we can only reach pairs that result in the same amout or even less amount.&#x20;

The solution is O(n) because our two pointers together go through the list exactly once.&#x20;

        l=0
        r=n-1
        currmax=0
        while l<r:
            currmax=max(min(height[l],height[r])*(r-l),currmax)
            if height[l]<height[r]:
                l+=1
            else:
                r-=1
        return currmax
```
