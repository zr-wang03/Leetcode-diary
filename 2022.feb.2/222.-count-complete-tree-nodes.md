# 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

* Medium
*   Given the `root` of a **complete** binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

    According to [**Wikipedia**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary\_tree#Types\_of\_binary\_trees), every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and `2h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

    Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.

### Analysis&#x20;

The first idea is a O(n) solution. We can go throught all the levels for all the nodes. It can be easily optimized if we skip the last row. Since all the above rows are completely filled in,we when see a node that does not have right/left child, we know the next row would be the last row.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        level=[root]
        nlevel=[]
        ans=0
        while level:
            for i in level:
                ans+=1
                if i.left:
                    nlevel.append(i.left)
                if i.right:
                    nlevel.append(i.right)
            level=nlevel
            nlevel=[]
        return ans
```

Since we know it is complete till the last level, we can test which of the children is the shorter one(left or right). Then, we don't need to traverse the complete one, instead we can calculate its number of nodes.&#x20;

class Solution:
        def countNodes(self, root):
            if not root:
                return 0
            leftDepth = self.getDepth(root.left)
            rightDepth = self.getDepth(root.right)
            if leftDepth == rightDepth:
                return pow(2, leftDepth) + self.countNodes(root.right)
            else:
                return pow(2, rightDepth) + self.countNodes(root.left)
    
        def getDepth(self, root):
            if not root:
                return 0
            return 1 + self.getDepth(root.left)
```
