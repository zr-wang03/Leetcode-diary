# 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

* Medium
*   Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing order**, remove some duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place\_algorithm) such that each unique element appears **at most twice**. The **relative order** of the elements should be kept the **same**.

    Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the **first part** of the array `nums`. More formally, if there are `k` elements after removing the duplicates, then the first `k` elements of `nums` should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first `k` elements.

    Return `k` _after placing the final result in the first_ `k` _slots of_ `nums`.

    Do **not** allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by **modifying the input array** [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place\_algorithm) with O(1) extra memory.

### Analysis&#x20;

In the solution there are two pointers, the slow pointer pointing at where the number should be replaced (possibily replaced) and the fast pointer just goes on until it reaches the end.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums):

        if len(nums)<2:
            return len(nums)
        slow,fast=2,2
        
        while fast<len(nums):
            if nums[slow-2]!=nums[fast]:
                nums[slow]=nums[fast]
                slow+=1
            fast+=1
        return slow
