# 240. Search a 2D Matrix II

* Medium
* Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value `target` in an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix`. This matrix has the following properties:
  * Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
  * Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.

### Analysis&#x20;

Given how the matrix is arranged, we can start with the top right corner. If the target is smaller than the current thing, we can go left. If the target is larger, than we go down. Eventually if we never meet the target, then we can return false.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def searchMatrix(self,matrix, target):
        m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix) and len(matrix[0])
        r, c = 0, n-1
        while r < m and c >= 0:
            if target > matrix[r][c]:
                r += 1
            elif target < matrix[r][c]:
                c -= 1
            else: return True
        return False
```
