# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

* Easy
*   You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

    You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

    Return _the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction_. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

### Solution (Python)

```
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        mini=prices[0]
        maxi=0
        for i in prices:
            if i<mini:
                mini=i
            if i-mini>maxi:
                maxi=i-mini
        return maxi
```

A more systematic solution, but not the best suit for this problem.

Suppose we build a 'difference' list recording the difference between the different prices, what we are looking for is a consecutive list that result in the highest total value.&#x20;

```
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        n=len(prices)
        count=0
        currentMax=0
        for i in range(n-1):
            count+=prices[i+1]-prices[i]
            if count<0:
                count=0
            if count>currentMax:
                currentMax=count
        return currentMax
        
```

### Solution (C)

```
int maxProfit(int* prices, int pricesSize){
	// If the initial value is zero, then it will not change
    int min = INT_MAX;
    int profit = 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < pricesSize; i++){
        if (prices[i] < min)
            min = prices[i];
        else if (prices[i] - min > profit)
            profit = prices[i] - min;
    }
    return profit;
}
```
