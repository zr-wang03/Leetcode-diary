# 15. 3Sum

* Medium
*   Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`.

    Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

### Analysis

First we set one number, than we look for a pair in the rest of the numbers that adds up to the target. This way we are transforming this question to a 2 Sum one.&#x20;

One additional tip is that we can first sort this list. After that, searching and solving the 2 sum problem will become easier and also when we are going through the list, we would have duplicates standing side by side. Therefore if we want to skip duplicates we know after where there might be duplicates and where we don't have to check.&#x20;
