# 563. Binary Tree Tilt

* Easy
* Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the sum of every tree node's **tilt**._
* The **tilt** of a tree node is the **absolute difference** between the sum of all left subtree node **values** and all right subtree node **values**. If a node does not have a left child, then the sum of the left subtree node **values** is treated as `0`. The rule is similar if there the node does not have a right child.

{% hint style="info" %}
A simple recursive method. The data that is passed through each recursion is the sum of the subtrees at the node. And the data we want is the difference in subtrees.&#x20;
