# 39. Combination Sum

* Medium
* Given an array of **distinct** integers `candidates` and a target integer `target`, return _a list of all **unique combinations** of_ `candidates` _where the chosen numbers sum to_ `target`_._ You may return the combinations in **any order**.
* The **same** number may be chosen from `candidates` an **unlimited number of times**. Two combinations are unique if the frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.
* It is **guaranteed** that the number of unique combinations that sum up to `target` is less than `150` combinations for the given input.

### Analysis

This is an example of a back-tracking problem. It asks us for all the possible combinations of numbers to get to the sum we want, therefore backtracking here and exhausting the possibilty space is going to work in this case.&#x20;

For this specific problem, since the candidate list is already sorted, we can pass in a pointer pointing at the last position in the candidate list we were looking at. Since we are allowed to use one number mutliple times, we allow the code to go from that exact place. But we don't want to go back to the numbers before otherwise we will have a repeating answer.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        self.candidates=candidates
        answer=[]
        ans=[]
        self.helper(0,target,ans,answer)
        return answer
        
        
    def helper(self,pointer,target,ans,answer):
        if target==0:
            answer.append(ans)
            return

        for i in range(pointer,len(self.candidates)):
            digit=self.candidates[i]
            if target-digit>=0:
                self.helper(i,target-digit,ans+[digit],answer)
```
