# 90. Subsets II

*   Given an integer array `nums` that may contain duplicates, return _all possible subsets (the power set)_.

    The solution set **must not** contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in **any order**.

### Analysis&#x20;

Look at [78.-subsets.md](../2022.jan.22/78.-subsets.md "mention") before this question. In that question, every number is unique, therefore for each number there is only two possibilities: appering once or don't appear. Here there might be duplicates in the array, so we count the time of appearance of every distinct number. For example, if 2 appeared 2 times in the array, when building the subset, there are 3 possiblities: " "(zero 2s),"2","22".&#x20;

Then the rest is regular back tracking problem.&#x20;

        number=[]
        count=0
        for i in nums:
            if i in seen:
                seen[i]+=1
            else:
                seen[i]=1
                number+=[i]
                count+=1
        ans=[]
        answer=[]
        #print(count)
        self.helper(0,count,ans,answer,number,seen)
        return answer
        
    def helper(self,k,count,ans,answer,number,seen):
        if k==count:
            answer.append(ans)
            return
        
        temp=number[k]
        tail=[]
        for i in range(seen[temp]+1):
            
            self.helper(k+1,count,ans+tail,answer,number,seen)
            tail+=[temp]
            #print(tail)
        return
