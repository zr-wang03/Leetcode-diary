# 45. Jump Game II

* Medium
*   Given an array of non-negative integers `nums`, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

    Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

    Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

    You can assume that you can always reach the last index.



### Analysis

This question can be solve with Dynamic Planning methods. We created l and r as two pointers to point the range we can reach within n steps. We initialize it with the range to be cover within one step, which is from 0 to nums\[0]. Then to avoid repetitive and useless calculation, and also because we are only interested in how far this can reach, we set l to be the current r and set r to be the furthest distance we can reach from this interval with just one step.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(nums)<=1:
            return 0;
        l,r=0,nums[0]
        time=1
        while r<len(nums)-1:
            maxi=0
            for i in range(l,r+1):
                maxi=max(maxi,nums[i]+i)
            l,r=r+1,maxi
            time+=1
        return time
```
