# 402. Remove K Digits

* Medium
* Given string num representing a non-negative integer `num`, and an integer `k`, return _the smallest possible integer after removing_ `k` _digits from_ `num`.

### Analysis&#x20;

How would we do the same thing by hand? The answer is if we see a digit that is smaller than the previous number, we delete the previous one, and we keep on doing that until we have removed k digits. The solution below uses the exact same logic. &#x20;

```
class Solution:
    def removeKdigits(self, num: str, k: int) -> str:    
        stack = []
        for digit in num:
            while k > 0 and len(stack) > 0 and stack[-1] > digit:
                k -= 1
                stack.pop()  
            stack.append(digit)
        if k > 0:
            stack = stack[:-k]     
        return "".join(stack).lstrip("0") or "0"
```
