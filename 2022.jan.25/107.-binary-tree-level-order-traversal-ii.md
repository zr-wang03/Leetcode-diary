# 107. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II

* Medium
* Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the bottom-up level order traversal of its nodes' values_. (i.e., from left to right, level by level from leaf to root).

### Analysis&#x20;

The first idea that comes to me is that this is exactly the same as [102.-binary-tree-level-order-traversal.md](../2022.jan.24/102.-binary-tree-level-order-traversal.md "mention"). The only difference is the order it comes out. So adding a reverse at the end would do the job.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def levelOrderBottom(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
        stack=[root]
        if not root:
            return []
        answer=[]
        while stack:
            temp=[]
            ans=[]
            for node in stack:
                if node.left:
                    temp.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    temp.append(node.right)
                ans.append(node.val)
            stack=temp
            answer.append(ans)
        return reversed(answer)
```
