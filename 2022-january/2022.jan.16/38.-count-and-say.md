# 38. Count and Say

* Medium
*   The **count-and-say** sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula:

    * `countAndSay(1) = "1"`
    * `countAndSay(n)` is the way you would "say" the digit string from `countAndSay(n-1)`, which is then converted into a different digit string.

    To determine how you "say" a digit string, split it into the **minimal** number of groups so that each group is a contiguous section all of the **same character.** Then for each group, say the number of characters, then say the character. To convert the saying into a digit string, replace the counts with a number and concatenate every saying.

    For example, the saying and conversion for digit string `"3322251"`:

    Given a positive integer `n`, return _the_ `nth` _term of the **count-and-say** sequence_.\


### Analysis

As the introduction said, the problem is defined by recursive formula, so we solve this using recursion. For each cycle, we take the countAndSay of lower level and build the current level.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def countAndSay(self, n: int) -> str:    
        if n==1:
            return "1"
        if n==2:
            return "11"
        string=self.countAndSay(n-1)
        length=len(string)
        ans=""
        count=1
       # print(n,string)
        curr=string[0]
        for i in range(1,length):
            if string[i]==curr:
                count+=1
            else:
                ans+=str(count)+curr
                count=1
                curr=string[i]
        ans+=str(count)+curr
        count=1
        curr=string[i]
        return ans
```
