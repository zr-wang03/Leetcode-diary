# 279. Perfect Squares

* Medium
*   Given an integer `n`, return _the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to_ `n`.

    A **perfect square** is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, `1`, `4`, `9`, and `16` are perfect squares while `3` and `11` are not.

### Analysis&#x20;

A BFS would give the solution to this problem. In searching, we want to see if a level of the tree can  satisfy the result, if not, we move on to the next level with one more number to add. The tree would  look like the following:&#x20;

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png>)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png>)

```
class Solution:
    def numSquares(self, n):
        if n < 2:
            return n
        lst = []
        i = 1
        while i * i <= n:
            lst.append( i * i )
            i += 1
        cnt = 0
        toCheck = {n}
        while toCheck:
            cnt += 1
            temp = set()
            for x in toCheck:
                for y in lst:
                    if x == y:
                        return cnt
                    if x < y:
                        break
                    temp.add(x-y)
            toCheck = temp

        return cnt
```
