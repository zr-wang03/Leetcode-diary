# 97. Interleaving String

* Medium
*   Given strings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`, find whether `s3` is formed by an **interleaving** of `s1` and `s2`.

    An **interleaving** of two strings `s` and `t` is a configuration where they are divided into **non-empty** substrings such that:

    * `s = s1 + s2 + ... + sn`
    * `t = t1 + t2 + ... + tm`
    * `|n - m| <= 1`
    * The **interleaving** is `s1 + t1 + s2 + t2 + s3 + t3 + ...` or `t1 + s1 + t2 + s2 + t3 + s3 + ...`

    **Note:** `a + b` is the concatenation of strings `a` and `b`.

### Analysis&#x20;

This problem is easier than it seems. For each digit in the s3 string, it either comes from the s1 string or from the s2 string. If a digit from s1 is already used, then it would not come into consideration afterwards. Therefore we can do DP and each time move the head of s1 and s2 a step forward. Then the digit in s3 can only be either s1's head or s2's head.&#x20;

                ans=helper(i+1,j) or ans
            if j<n and s2[j]==s3[i+j]:
                ans=helper(i,j+1) or ans
            return ans 
        
        
        
        return helper(0,0)
