# 306. Additive Number

* Medium
*   An **additive number** is a string whose digits can form an **additive sequence**.

    A valid **additive sequence** should contain **at least** three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

    Given a string containing only digits, return `true` if it is an **additive number** or `false` otherwise.

    **Note:** Numbers in the additive sequence **cannot** have leading zeros, so sequence `1, 2, 03` or `1, 02, 3` is invalid.

### Analysis

First we try to split the first and second number out from the sequence. Then when we have those two numbers, we will have the numberic value of the list we are looking for. Splitting the string into the target length and we will be able to check if it matches. If it doesn't match, then the pair (first and second) is not useful and we have to look for another pair.&#x20;

To make the program faster, we can limit the length of each number to be less than or equal to 1/2 of the total length that is left. (Or if it is equal to the length of the remaining sequence).&#x20;

For example, if we have the following string. "199200199"

First we will be dividing the sequence into '1' and '9'. Now the third number we would hope is 1+9=10. 10 is of length 2, so we take two digits from the remaining set and we have "92". 92!=10 so '1' and '9' is not going to work.&#x20;

Next we try the same for '1' and '99'. 100!=200. so it does not work either.&#x20;

Similar for '1' and '992'. Then '1' and '9920'.

But we can stop here for 1 and we know that increasing the length of the second number would not do us any good after this. Why?&#x20;

Taking the '1' out, we would have 8 digits remaining in the string. If the second number is of 4 digits, say "1987", then the third number would have 4 or 5 digits (9999+1=10000 with 5 digits). But if we split the string so that the second number is of 5 digits, then there will only be 3 digits left for the third number. And a one digit number + a five digit number can never be a three digit number.&#x20;

                    else:

                    #if the pair works, return True
                    return True
                    
        #if none of the pairs work 
        return False    
```

Further improvements:  if we keep using "str" instead of "int" the solution might be more elegant.&#x20;
