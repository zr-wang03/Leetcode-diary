# 394. Decode String

* Medium
*   Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

    The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where the `encoded_string` inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly `k` times. Note that `k` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

    You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

    Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and that digits are only for those repeat numbers, `k`. For example, there will not be input like `3a` or `2[4]`.

### Analysis&#x20;

The number of repetition comes after the string to be repeated, therefore we can build a stack to keep track of the string yet to be repeated and add the repeated ones after we have seen the number of repetition.&#x20;

class Solution(object):
    def decodeString(self, s):
        stack = []; curNum = 0; curString = ''
        for c in s:
            if c == '[':
                stack.append(curString)
                stack.append(curNum)
                curString = ''
                curNum = 0
            elif c == ']':
                num = stack.pop()
                prevString = stack.pop()
                curString = prevString + num*curString
            elif c.isdigit():
                curNum = curNum*10 + int(c)
            else:
                curString += c
        return curString
```
