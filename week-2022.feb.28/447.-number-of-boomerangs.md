# 447. Number of Boomerangs

* Medium
*   You are given `n` `points` in the plane that are all **distinct**, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`. A **boomerang** is a tuple of points `(i, j, k)` such that the distance between `i` and `j` equals the distance between `i` and `k` **(the order of the tuple matters)**.

    Return _the number of boomerangs_.

### Analysis&#x20;

For each node in the plane, we create a dictionary recording the number of nodes at i distance away from them. Then we can use combination to calculate how many combinations there might be in that.&#x20;

    def numberOfBoomerangs(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        ans=0
        for p1 in points:
            dic=defaultdict(int)
            for p2 in points:
                i=p1[0]-p2[0]
                j=p1[1]-p2[1]
                dic[i**2+j**2]+=1
            for k in dic.values():
                ans+=k*(k-1)
        return ans
