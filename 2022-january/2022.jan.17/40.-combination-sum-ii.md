# 40. Combination Sum II

* Medium
*   Given a collection of candidate numbers (`candidates`) and a target number (`target`), find all unique combinations in `candidates` where the candidate numbers sum to `target`.

    Each number in `candidates` may only be used **once** in the combination.

    **Note:** The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

### Analysis&#x20;

This problem is similar as the previous one [39.-combination-sum.md](39.-combination-sum.md "mention"). The difference is that: First the candidates is not sorted. Second, each number can only be used once for creating the sum. Therefore we only need to make minor improvements to the previous code.&#x20;



```
class Solution:
    def combinationSum2(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        candidates.sort()
        self.candidates=candidates
        print(self.candidates)
        answer=[]
        ans=[]
        self.helper(-1,target,ans,answer)
        return answer
        
        
    def helper(self,pointer,target,ans,answer):
        if target==0:
            answer.append(ans)
            return
        
        #here we change the start from pointer to pointer+1, this makes sure that
        #each number can only be used once. 
        for i in range(pointer+1,len(self.candidates)):
            digit=self.candidates[i]
            
            #This if is to skip those answers that start with the same number. 
            #If the list contains [1,1,6,7], we can accept an sum like 1+1+6=8
            #But we don't want 1+6=1+6.
            if i>pointer+1 and self.candidates[i]==self.candidates[i-1]:
                continue
                
            if target-digit>=0:
                self.helper(i,target-digit,ans+[digit],answer)
```
