# 390. Elimination Game

* Medium
*   You have a list `arr` of all integers in the range `[1, n]` sorted in a strictly increasing order. Apply the following algorithm on `arr`:

    * Starting from left to right, remove the first number and every other number afterward until you reach the end of the list.
    * Repeat the previous step again, but this time from right to left, remove the rightmost number and every other number from the remaining numbers.
    * Keep repeating the steps again, alternating left to right and right to left, until a single number remains.

    Given the integer `n`, return _the last number that remains in_ `arr`.

### Analysis&#x20;

This seems more like a math problem than an algorithm one.  The idea behind is really simple.&#x20;

```
class Solution:
    def lastRemaining(self, n):
        def helper(n, isLeft):
            if(n==1): return 1
            if(isLeft):
                return 2*helper(n//2, 0)
    # if started from left side the odd elements will be removed, the only remaining ones will the the even i.e.
    #       [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]==   [2 4 6 8]==     2*[1 2 3 4]
            elif(n%2==1):
                return 2*helper(n//2, 1)
    # same as left side the odd elements will be removed
            else:
                return 2*helper(n//2, 1) - 1
    # even elements will be removed and the only left ones will be [1 2 3 4 5 6 ]== [1 3 5]== 2*[1 2 3] - 1
            
        return helper(n, 1)
```
