# 238. Product of Array Except Self

* Medium
*   Given an integer array `nums`, return _an array_ `answer` _such that_ `answer[i]` _is equal to the product of all the elements of_ `nums` _except_ `nums[i]`.

    The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

    You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

### Analysis&#x20;

The idea is that we run 2 rounds on the array. The first round we calculate the product of the numbers before the i th, and in the second round we calculate those after the i th. By taking the product of that we get the answer we wanted.&#x20;

class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums):
        p = 1
        n = len(nums)
        output = []
        for i in range(0,n):
            output.append(p)
            p = p * nums[i]
        p = 1
        for i in range(n-1,-1,-1):
            output[i] = output[i] * p
            p = p * nums[i]
        return output
```
