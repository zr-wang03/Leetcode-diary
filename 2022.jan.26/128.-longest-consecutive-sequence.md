# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

* Medium
*   Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return _the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence._

    You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.
*   **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
    ```

    **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
    Output: 9
    ```



### Analysis&#x20;

For each number in the list, if it is not previously counted in any list, we can see how long a list starting with it would be and compare that to the current best. And both the things stated here are easy to test: For a value n, if n-1 is not in the list, then it means that n cannot appear in any other list before.&#x20;

        nums=set(nums)
        best=0
        for x in nums:
            if x-1 not in nums:
                y=x+1
                while y in nums:
                    y+=1
                best=max(best,y-x)
        return best
```
